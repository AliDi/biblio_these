  Abstract                 = {Measurements were taken in the Virginia Tech Anechoic Wall Jet Facility to study the directivity of roughness noise produced by single 8mm and 3mm cubes and varying size grid patterns of 3mm cubes. Boundary layer thickness to roughness height ratios varied from 2-5.3 over the examined conditions. An arrangement of 8 far field microphones creating two arcs overtop and around the side of the roughness were used in combination with a linear microphone array of 32 sensors which was resting on the flat plate of the wall jet. Single microphone data, beamformed source images, and a least-squares method were used to characterize the noise produced by the rough surfaces. The least-squares method was used to estimate the source strengths of both streamwise and spanwise dipoles originating from the cubic roughness by minimizing the error between the measured spectra and model spectra. This method was validated for frequencies above 10kHz by comparison with single microphone measurements. The results show that the strength of the streamwise dipole emanating from a single element was found to be equal to or stronger than the spanwise dipole. Finally, the lead row of a multi-row fetch of cubic roughness elements produced the strongest spanwise dipole and the strength of the spanwise dipole decreased with each succeeding row.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic beamforming is an experimental tool that can be used to locate and quantify aeroacoustic noise sources. Much of the available aeroacoustic beamforming literature presents beamforming results of noise at relatively high frequencies. There are few experimental acoustic beamforming results for acoustic frequencies between 1 kHz and 5 kHz, although much of the literature for airfoil self noise at low to moderate Reynolds number fits in this frequency range. One difficulty with acoustic beamforming of relatively low frequency noise is the large size of the main lobe in the beamformer output, resulting in a potential inability to resolve acoustic sources within close proximity to each other. This paper provides a detailed comparison between grid, randomized, logarithmic spiral and modified logarithmic spiral arrays and a discussion of the performance of each array type over a range of low frequencies (1 kHz-5 kHz). The spiral arrays were found to have lower sidelobe levels over a wider frequency range than the grid and random array. For frequencies less than 4.84 kHz and greater than 12.36 kHz, the modified logarithmic spiral exhibited smaller sidelobe magnitudes than the unmodified logarithmic spiral. An experimental verification of a modified logarithmic spiral using a small headphone in an anechoic environment is also provided. This showed that the error of the measured noise source locations placed 600 mm from the array plane is within 20 mm for the series of locations studied. The estimation error was shown to be dependent on the source location and direction from the center of the array.},

  Abstract                 = {The Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is a standard method to localize acoustic sounds as well as brain sources in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In one of its variants used for EEG/MEG source analysis, called RAP-MUSIC, sequential projections were proposed to properly identify local maxima of the gain function as origins of true sources. The purpose of this paper is twofold: a) we introduce the concept of RAP-MUSIC to the acoustic community, and b) we extend the RAP-MUSIC approach to a fully recursive algorithm. The latter highly suppresses distortions of the estimate of each source due to the presence of other sources. The method is demonstrated for a measurement of the sounds of two loudspeakers placed on a table in a reverberant room. We presented the localization results for Delay and Sum(DAS) beamformer, RAP-MUSIC and SC-MUSIC. In contrast to both DAS beamformer and RAP-MUSIC the new method correctly localizes and separates four sources: the two loudspeakers and the two respective echoes},

  Review                   = {Open jet wind tunnels have become commonplace in aeroacoustic testing, as having an open-jet test section in an anechoic chamber can provide a near-anechoic environment when ttempting to measure acoustic field levels due to an aeroacoustic source. Additionally, reduced flow is present over installation microphones, so SNR gains are observed versus equivalent closed test section experiments. However, open-jet wind tunnels and their acoustic treatment introduce additional noise sources which may contaminate a given signal of interest. To overcome this limitation, multiple-microphone processing techniques involving coherent power and/or beamforming are often leveraged. These techniques can isolate the behavior of an aeroacoustic noise source using different types of assumptions. However, depending on the facility background noise characteristics and measurement setup these assumptions may be violated. A comparison of these techniques is conducted using a NACA 63-215 Mod-B airfoil in UFAFF, and shows that when the signal of interest, trailing edge noise, is not the dominant noise source, facility flow noise can introduce aberrant behavior to the coherent power and array processing techniques. This behavior leads to correspondingly large uncertainty bounds in output power spectra. Modifications to the wind tunnel facility and experimental setup are proposed to mitigate these problems, and a new experiment set with a smaller NACA 0012 airfoil is designed. Results show that modifications appear to improve the behavior of coherent power methods, specifically those tailored to trailing edge noise measurements, significantly. Major disagreement between coherent power techniques and delay-and-sum integration is found even with significant mitigation of facility contaminating noise sources. Uncertainty analysis does not account for the difference visible between the methods, suggesting that further analysis involving deconvolution and coherent source behavior is warranted.}

  Abstract                 = {Microphone arrays can be used to localize and estimate the strengths of acoustic sources present in a region of interest. In general, microphone array processing algorithms assume line-of-sight acoustic wave propagation from each source to each microphone. However, when the microphone array is placed outside the jet in an open-jet test section, the presence of the shear layer refracts the acoustic waves and causes the wave propagation times (from each source to each microphone) to be different than in the case without the shear layer. With a known source location in space, the change in propagation times can be determined by using Amiet’s method (J. Sound Vib., Vol. 58, 1978). We investigate the effects of shear layer refraction on the conventional delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm by using a pulsed laser system to generate a plasma point source in space and time within the test section at several different test section flow speeds and configurations with varying levels of complexity. The results indicate that Amiet’s method properly corrects for shear layer refraction effects when the source is in the inviscid core of the open-jet test section, as well as when the source is located in a simple thin wake. When the source is in a complex wake region, the quantitative agreement degrades although overall trends are correct.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic arrays have become an important testing tool in noise identiﬁcation for industry applications, where the typical beamforming algorithm has been adopted as a classical processing technique. In most practical cases the beamforming computations have to be conducted off-line due to the excessive computational requirements. An alternative algorithm with a real-time capability is proposed. The algorithm is similar to a classic observer while array processing is performed in the frequency domain. The performance of this observer-based algorithmis studied here through comparing with the typical beamforming method, particulary for a case of coherent noise sources. In this paper it is shown that the observer-based algorithm could resolve the coherence restriction between the background noise and the signal of interest. The proposed algorithm is also beneﬁcial for its capability of operating over sampling blocks recursively. The convergence rate of this recursive algorithm is fast enough to satisfy the requirements for practical cases. The experimental efforts could be saved extensively as any testing defects could be revealed instantaneously and corrected on site. In addition, this innovative approach provides an alternative perspective, from which many techniques already developed in control and ﬁltering could be extended to this new application area of array processing.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper demonstrates that optimum weighting coefficients and inverse filters for microphone arrays can be accomplished, with the aid of a systematic methodology of mathematical programming. Both far-field and near-field array problems are formulated in terms of convex optimization formalism. Three application examples, including data-independent far-field array design, nearfield array design, and pressure field interpolation, are presented. In far-field array design, array coefficients are optimized to tradeoff Directivity Index for White Noise Gain or the coefficient norm, while in nearfield array convex optimization is applied to design Equivalent Source Method-based Nearfield Acoustical Holography. Numerical examples are given for designing a far-field two-dimensional random array comprised of thirty microphones. For far-field arrays, five design approaches, including a Delay-And-Sum beamformer, a Super Directivity Array, three optimal arrays designed using ℓ1,ℓ2, and ℓ∞-norms, are compared. Numerical and experimental results have shown that sufficiently high White Noise Gain was crucial to robust performance of array against sensor mismatch and noise. For nearfield arrays, inverse filters were designed in light of Equivalent Source Method and convex optimization to reconstruct the velocity field on a baffled spherical piston source. The proposed nearfield design is benchmarked by those designed using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Tikhonov Regularization. Compressive Sampling and convex optimization is applied to pressure field reconstruction, source separation and modal analysis with satisfactory performance in both near-field and far-field microphone arrays.},

  Abstract                 = {According to ISO 140-4, pressure level measurements are usually carried out to evaluate the airborne noise insulation. This standard provides no information about parts of the element under test that present a reduced insulation. To solve this problem, intensity measurements based on ISO 15186-2 can be taken. Nevertheless, this solution implies a long time due to the high number of measurement points required. This paper introduces different tests to assess the in-situ airborne noise insulation through SONAH and Beamforming techniques. This makes it easier and quicker the calculation of the insulation of these parts of interest. In these experiments, the intensity magnitude has been obtained through SONAH or Beamforming measurements to derive the airborne noise insulation of a separating element, or a part of it, applying the calculation procedure indicated by the ISO 15186-2 for that. The experiments have been carried out for four constructive elements: a double-wall and three doors made up of common materials (wood, glass, sheet). To determine the accuracy obtained with these experiments, the insulation of the tested elements has been determined in advance by the standardized procedures of pressure and intensity, so that a valid comparison with the results given by SONAH and Beamforming could be established},

  Abstract                 = {Traffic noise is one of the most important noise sources in industrialized countries. In order to control this kind of noise, it is important to identify and to quantify the noise sources during the pass-by of a car. Standardised methods for vehicle and tyre/road noise measurements only provide results about the time history of the sound, the sound pressure level emitted or the spectrum, but it is impossible to identify the main noise sources. Other advanced measurement methods, as sound intensity, identify the noise source but have the problem of positioning the transducers during the pass-by measurements. In this paper, a new methodology to apply Beamforming for pass-by measurements on cars is described. To define this methodology, simulations were performed in order to design the array, the measurement scenario and to choose the beamforming algorithm most suited to process the pass-by measurement data. Once the methodology was established, it was applied to a real measurement. The results obtained were similar to other published in the literature and therefore, the applicability of the new methodology was confirmed.},

These arrays comprised one- and two-dimensional arrangements of up to 29 microphones. The characteristics peculiar to microphone arrays will be mentioned only briefly here, because the theoretical background of array measurements is available in other publications. Within the context of the present paper, the sound sources located are those generated mechanically, principally by wheel/rail interactions, and those produced by aerodynamic fluctuations. In addition, noise radiation from cooling systems was also measured during passages of the trains. Examples are given of results obtained with different kinds of arrays during pass-bys of dedicated ICEs and goods trains. These examples demonstrate the usefulness of array measurements for producing detailed information pertaining to the characteristics of individual sound sources. With respect to these individual sound sources particularly on moving vehicles, array technology provides a much more efficient and capable tool for investigating these sources than does the more conventional technique employing single microphones.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the discrimination of inlet / exhaust noise of aero-engines in free-field static tests using far-field semi-circular microphone arrays. Three approaches are considered for this problem: focused beamforming, inverse method with Tikhonov regularization and inverse method with beamforming matrix regularization (called hybrid method). The classical beamforming method is disadvantaged due to need for a high number of measurement microphones in accordance to the requirements. Similarly, the Inverse methods are disadvantaged due to their need of having an a-priori source information. The classical Tikhonov regularization provides improvements in solution stability, however continues to be disadvantaged due to its requirement of imposing a stronger penalty for undetected source positions. The proposed hybrid method builds upon the beneficial attributes of both the beamforming and inverse methods, and has been validated using experiments conducted in hemi-anechoic conditions with a small-scale waveguide system simulating a gas turbine engine. The method has further been applied to the measured noise data from a Pratt & Whitney Canada turbo-fan engine and has been observed to provide better spatial resolution and solution robustness with a limited number of measurement microphones compared to the existing methods. More validation work is ongoing.},

It consists of an array of microphones connected to a small digital computer, via a sequence of preamplifiers, analog filters and analog to digital converters and multiplexer.

The whole system can be transported in a small estate car and can be used on both model scale and full size engine test rigs.

  Abstract                 = {A spectral estimation method based on measurements by a phased array was developed to estimate absolute power levels radiated by compact or extended sources. After a brief recall of its principle, numerical simulations involving several source regions are presented to illustrate the accuracy and the high-resolution performances of this new method. Tests were carried out with a 1:11th scale A320/A321 Airbus model in the anechoic wind tunnel CEPRA 19. The characteristics of source regions from inboard to outboard of the wing slat and ﬂap, and the main and nose landing gear subregions are examined. The dependence in level and frequency of the model subregions with the ﬂow speed, the effects of the attack angle, and the effects of the ﬂap or slat deployment are studied. The different trends revealed by the integrated power levels are also discussed. Examples of the localization of noise sources identiﬁed with conventional beam forming and the new method are presented. The consistency of the results is examined by comparing the integrated power levels for the complete wing and the measured spectra with the phased array. Finally, we show that the spectral estimation method is quite reliable in computing the far-ﬁeld directivity of airframe noise sources.},

  Abstract                 = {Array processing is a powerful tool to extract the noise source characteristics from the acoustic signals measured during wind-tunnels tests. For many years, this measurement technology is commonly being used to study airframe noise. Conventional beam forming methods have proven their efﬁciency in source localization, but it is well known that they are limited in the estimation of the power levels of extended sources. An approach based on a spectral estimation method (SEM) is proposed in order to determine the actual sound-pressure levels of the acoustic sources found by the localization method. The SEM is based on the array cross-spectral matrix, which contains an indirect measurement of the source power levels of interest and on a modeling of this matrix. Optimal estimates of the actual source power levels can be obtained by minimizing the mean square error between the measurement and model matrices. However, the direct minimization suffers from the sensitivity to noise inherent in the ill-posed nature of the problem. To obtain meaningful results, the problem is regularized by using a priori information. Numerical simulations involving multiple source areas are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the estimation procedure. The method is successfully applied to compute the power levels of the main sources on a 1/11th-scaled model of the Airbus A320/A321 tested in CEPRA 19 wind tunnel.},

  Abstract                 = {Array Processing ( AP ) is a powerful tool to extract the noise source characteristics from the signals that are measured during tests performed in wind tunnel facility. This kind of means of investigation has been intensively used to study the airframe noise generated by a 1/11th scaled model Airbus A320/A321 during an experiment conducted in the CEPRA 19 anechoic wind tunnel. In particular, a Localization Method (LM ) has allowed to identity the main noise sources on the aircraft model with a good accuracy. This paper proposes a Spectral Estimation Method (SEM ) in order to associate the actual Power Spectral Density ( PSD ) of the acoustic sources found by the LM . The SEM is based on the measurement of the Cross-Spectral Density Matrix (CSDM ) which contains the PSD of interest and on a model of this matrix. A minimization of the mean square error between the two CSDM is adopted to obtain the estimates of the actual PSD . However, the direct minimization may lead to non acceptable PSD . The a priori knowledge on the positivity of the PSD is incorporated in the algorithm to compute the desired solutions. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimation procedure.},

The objective was to investigate the possibility of localizing the noise sources radiated by the helicopter from measurements performed with an array of ground fixed microphones. This study is based on a method that works in frequency domain to successfully localize the airframe noise sources on an aircraft in flight. The acoustic sources identified in this framework are localized on the main rotor disk or on the fenestron depending on the frequency band and on the flight conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Particularly the method has been applied to localize the blade vortex interaction noise sources that are dominant during descending flight. The results obtained for this flight condition are compared with the locations found by another method in the time domain from data collected with on-board microphones. Both methods give consistent source distributions on the main rotor disk.},

De-convolution methods are able to compensate for these characteristics and make the interpretation of the results easier. However, when de-convolution methods are applied to moving sources, additional difficulties arise. These are, for example, the spectral spreading of the point spread function and the very short averaging times. In this study, the specific problems with the analysis of moving sources are addressed. A point spread function for moving sources is formulated and applied to the simple de-convolution method CLEAN. In the analysis of flyover measurement data of an Airbus A320, this method significantly improves the quality of the source distributions. The modified point spread functions are also successfully tested with the DAMAS algorithm for simulated moving point sources.},

  Abstract                 = {The research institutes DLR in Germany and ISVR in Great Britain are developing together with Rolls-Royce, one of the major aero-engine manufacturers, methods for acoustic indoor measurements. These methods will allow acoustic tests to be performed in semi-reverberant aero-engine test cells. Currently, static noise tests are performed on open-air test beds in order to ensure free-field condition. However, open-air tests are prone to delays due to unfavorable whether conditions. Also, expensive noise protection installations might be required if the test bed is located close to communities. The presentation first introduces two novel methods developed by DLR and ISVR. Their effectiveness will be demonstrated using the results obtained in simulations and in experiments using loud speakers as noise sources. Both methods will be verified by comparing the radiated far-field noise of a Rolls-Royce BR715 engine measured under free field conditions and the far-field noise estimated from measurements taken in one of the standard development and production pass off test beds at Rolls-Royce Deutschland in Dahlewitz. This final test is going to be performed under the framework of the German research project LEXMOS.},

  Abstract                 = {Two-dimensional images of sound source distribution from near-ground airborne sounds are created using an array of 32 microphones and time-domain beamforming. The signal processing is described and array configurations spanning a square area with a side length of 3.45 m, approximately five wavelengths for a 500 Hz sound, are examined. Simulations of a 32-element under-populated log6 × log6 spaced array are given for sound sources centered over the array at 250 Hz, 500 Hz, and 1000 Hz. Stochastically optimized array geometry with a simulated annealing algorithm is discussed and a 32-element array optimized for a 500 Hz source is given along with a simulated image for direct comparison with the log6 spaced array. Images from field testing a 32-element under-populated log6 × log6 spaced array are provided for a small aircraft flyover. Results show that this type of acoustic camera generates accurate images of sound source location. Suggested uses include monitoring small aircraft flying too low to be detected by radar as well as monitoring ecological events, such as bird migration.},

  Abstract                 = {A jet noise measurement study was conducted using a phased microphone array system for a range of jet nozzle configurations and flow conditions. The test effort included convergent and convergent/divergent single flow nozzles, as well as conventional and chevron dual-flow core and fan configurations. Cold jets were tested with and without wind tunnel co-flow, whereas, hot jets were tested only with co-flow. The intent of the measurement effort was to allow evaluation of new phased array technologies for their ability to separate and quantify distributions of jet noise sources. In the present paper, the array post-processing method focused upon is DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources) for the quantitative determination of spatial distributions of noise sources. Jet noise is highly complex with stationary and convecting noise sources, convecting flows that are the sources themselves, and shock-related and screech noise for supersonic flow. The analysis presented in this paper addresses some processing details with DAMAS, for the array positioned at 90° (normal) to the jet. The paper demonstrates the applicability of DAMAS and how it indicates when strong coherence is present. Also, a new approach to calibrating the array focus and position is introduced and demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study reports a new development of the DAMAS microphone phased array processing methodology that allows the determination and separation of coherent and incoherent noise source distributions. In 2004, a Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) was developed which decoupled the array design and processing influence from the noise being measured, using a simple and robust algorithm. In 2005, three-dimensional applications of DAMAS were examined. DAMAS has been shown to render an unambiguous quantitative determination of acoustic source position and strength. However, an underlying premise of DAMAS, as well as that of classical array beamforming methodology, is that the noise regions under study are distributions of statistically independent sources. The present development, called DAMAS-C, extends the basic approach to include coherence definition between noise sources. The solutions incorporate cross-beamforming array measurements over the survey region. While the resulting inverse problem can be large and the iteration solution computationally demanding, it solves problems no other technique can approach. DAMAS-C is validated using noise source simulations and is applied to airframe flap noise test results.},

  Abstract                 = {At the 2004 AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustic Conference, a breakthrough in acoustic microphone array technology was reported by the authors. A Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) was developed which decouples the array design and processing influence from the noise being measured, using a simple and robust algorithm. For several prior airframe noise studies, it was shown to permit an unambiguous and accurate determination of acoustic source position and strength. As a follow-on effort, this paper examines the technique for three-dimensional (3D) applications. First, the beamforming ability for arrays, of different size and design, to focus longitudinally and laterally is examined for a range of source positions and frequency. Advantage is found for larger array designs with higher density microphone distributions towards the center. After defining a 3D grid generalized with respect to the array’s beamforming characteristics, DAMAS is employed in simulated and experimental noise test cases. It is found that spatial resolution is much less sharp in the longitudinal direction in front of the array compared to side-to-side lateral resolution. 3D DAMAS becomes useful for sufficiently large arrays at sufficiently high frequency. But, such can be a challenge to computational capabilities, with regard to the required expanse and number of grid points. Also, larger arrays can strain basic physical modeling assumptions that DAMAS and all traditional array methodologies use. An important experimental result is that turbulent shear layers can negatively impact attainable beamforming resolution. Still, the usefulness of 3D DAMAS is demonstrated by the measurement of landing gear noise source distributions in a difficult hard-wall wind tunnel environment.},

  Abstract                 = {An aeroacoustic model test has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms of sound generation on high-lift wing configurations. This paper presents an analysis of flap side-edge noise, which is often the most dominant source. A model of a main element wing section with a half-span flap was tested at low speeds of up to a Mach number of 0.17, corresponding to a wing chord Reynolds number of approximately 1.7 million. Results are presented for flat (or blunt), flanged, and round flap-edge geometries, with and without boundary-layer tripping, deployed at both moderate and high flap angles. The acoustic database is obtained from a small aperture directional array (SADA) of microphones, which was constructed to electronically steer to different regions of the model and to obtain farfield noise spectra and directivity from these regions. The basic flap-edge aerodynamics is established by static surface pressure data, as well as by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and simplified edge flow analyses. Distributions of unsteady pressure sensors over the flap allow the noise source regions to be defined and quantified via cross-spectral diagnostics using the SADA output. It is found that shear layer instability and related pressure scatter is the primary noise mechanism. For the flat edge flap, two noise prediction methods based on unsteady-surface-pressure measurements are evaluated and compared to measured noise. One is a new causality spectral approach developed here. The other is a new application of an edge-noise scatter prediction method. The good comparisons for both approaches suggest that the prediction models capture much of the physics. Areas of disagreement appear to reveal when the assumed edge noise mechanism does not fully define the noise production. For the different edge conditions, extensive spectra and directivity are presented. The complexity of the directivity results demonstrate the strong role of edge source geometry and frequency in the noise radiation. Significantly, for each edge configuration, the spectra for different flow speeds, flap angles, and surface roughness were successfully scaled by utilizing aerodynamic performance and boundary-layer scaling methods developed herein.},

  Abstract                 = {A study was conducted to examine the effects of overall size of directional (or phased) arrays on the measurement of aeroacoustic components. An airframe model was mounted in the potential core of an open-jet windtunnel, with the directional arrays located outside the flow in an anechoic environment. Two array systems were used; one with a solid measurement angle that encompasses 31.6° of source directivity and a smaller one that encompasses 7.2°. The arrays, and sub-arrays of various sizes, measured noise from a calibrator source and flap edge model setups. In these cases, noise was emitted from relatively small, but finite size source regions, with intense levels compared to other sources. Although the larger arrays revealed much more source region detail, the measured source levels were substantially reduced due to finer resolution compared to that of the smaller arrays. To better understand the measurements quantitatively, an analytical model was used to define the basic relationships between array to source region sizes and measured output level. Also, the effect of noise scattering by shear layer turbulence was examined using the present data and those of previous studies. Taken together, the two effects were sufficient to explain spectral level differences between arrays of different sizes. An important result of this study is that total (integrated) noise source levels are retrievable and the levels are independent of the array size as long as certain experimental and processing criteria are met. The criteria for both open and closed tunnels are discussed. The success of special purpose diagonal-removal processing in obtaining integrated results is apparently dependent in part on source distribution. Also discussed is the fact that extended sources are subject to substantial measurement error, especially for large arrays.},

  Abstract                 = {A method will be presented which allows a construction of an acoustic source model based on the analysis of microphone array measurements during a train pass-by. The conventional array beam-forming technique is used as a kind of pre-processing or first order analysis to calculate in a second step the true source strengths by a back-projection method. The final equation to be solved connects the source power distribution on the vehicle surface with the measured microphone array amplitudes via a Green's function transfer matrix. By these means the side-lobe effects of the array characteristics as well as the Doppler frequency shift and amplitude augmentation of the sources are removed. The model is updated for consecutive time slices during the pass-by so that it is possible to study directional and time-dependent effects on the source characteristics. The method has been applied to measurements on the ICE-V train where three known artificial noise sources (loudspeakers) had been mounted on the outside of the sidewall. The source power distribution function gives a much better source separation than the conventional beam-forming result. The calculated source strengths show a good agreement with the true values.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-series pressure data were saved on a surface in the near acoustic region of the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of a Mach 0.9 round-nozzle jet-flow. The data amount to sampling from an ideal acoustic phased array (with zero self noise and perfect frequency response, within the known limitations of the LES). The data were converted into crossspectral matrices and beamformed using frequency-domain conventional beamforming as in experiments. Only a small sub-set of the points available from the LES has been used so far. The results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining beamformer acoustic maps using LES solution pressure time series data. Potential benefits of this type of exercise include, but are not limited to: a) improved phased-array designs for given test configurations; b) improved array-processing algorithms; c) improved understanding of processing algorithm output (beamform maps) and relationship to flowfield; d) insight into the physics of the flowfield; and e) insight into possible flaws of the LES.

  Abstract                 = {Increased restrictions on large commercial aircraft noise levels during takeoff and approach have spawned increased interest in the localization of subcomponent noise sources and quantification of their levels. Landing gear are the dominant sources of airframe noise during approach, with additional contributions from deployed slats, flaps, flaperons and so on. Jet noise, of course, dominates during takeoff. The acoustic phased array is a powerful flight test tool for imaging the noise sources on the aircraft. The acoustic phased array is a spatially distributed set of microphones which simultaneously sample the acoustic field. By appropriately time delaying the output of individual microphones, the origin and level of a given noise source can potentially be determined. The success of this approach depends largely on 1) the actual character of the source (monopole, dipole, etc.), 2) the phased array design, and 3) the array data processing method. This paper focuses on aspects of the latter two areas. The objectives of this paper are to a) present the flight test benefits accrued using large aperture phased arrays and, b) examine the utility of recently developed array processing methods for quantifying flight test aircraft subcomponent noise source levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Three configurations of ground-mounted microphones have been used to obtain phased array measurements of the exhaust noise from a full-scale GE90-115B engine. The configurations included the standard 150-foot polar arc array present at all static engine acoustic tests, a second, linear distribution of microphones designed to localize and quantify the jet noise sources at and downstream of the exhaust nozzles, and a third, multi-arm logspiral array designed to resolve the fan and core exhaust noise sources at the nozzle exits. These data represent perhaps the most extensive and comprehensive collection of phased array measurements of full-scale engine exhaust noise ever acquired. The present results focus exclusively on baseline nozzle measurements made at a high engine power level setting. The arc array is shown to provide basic information on jet noise source structure. The log spiral array is shown to be capable of resolving the fan and core exhaust noise sources at the nozzle exits. The linear array is shown to provide the capability for describing the variation in jet noise source location with temporal frequency and emission angle. This paper seeks to illustrate the benefits and numerous challenges associated with the use of this powerful technology within the complexities of a full-scale test.},

  Abstract                 = {Two phased microphone arrays were developed for an aeroacoustic test of a 26 % scale model of a Boeing 777 commercial airliner. Model size and a broad frequency range of interest required that two custom arrays be used in tandem during the STAR (Subsonic Transport Aeroacoustic Research) test. A 70-microphone, 244 cm (96 in) array provided a spatial resolution of 3.4 λ with moderate sidelobes under 10 kHz. A smaller 102 cm (40 in) traversing array was used to measure source directivity and provide accurate sound pressure levels with a useful range of 1 to 25 kHz and a spatial resolution of 6.5 λ . The acoustic performance of both arrays was optimized using a simulated annealing method to minimize sidelobe levels and beamwidth. Both arrays used a recessed microphone Kevlar™ drumhead design to reduce microphone self-noise. Recessing the array below Kevlar™ reduces background noise by as much as 20 dB by isolating the microphones from the turbulent boundary layer. The array data must be corrected for effects of the resonance created between the array plates and the Kevlar™. Broadband speaker sources as well as airframe noise sources were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two phased arrays. Numerous airframe noise sources and noise reduction technologies were thoroughly documented using these two custom arrays in the large-scale STAR test.},

  Abstract                 = {Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) is the most common occupational disease in the U.S. with devastating consequences particularly in the mining industry. A study conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) revealed that 90% of coal miners have hearing impairment by age 50, compared to only 10% of those not exposed to occupational noise. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Continuous Mining Machine (CM) operators account for 30% of workers exposed to noise doses exceeding the Permissible Exposure Level (PEL). This number becomes more dramatic considering that 49% of the total national underground coal production is extracted using these machines. In this context, NIOSH is conducting research to identify and control dominant noise sources in CMs. Previous noise source identification was performed using a Brüel &Kjær (B&K) 1.92-m diameter, 42-microphone phased array. These measurements revealed that the impacts from the conveyor chain onto the tail roller, and the impacts from the conveyor chain onto the upper deck are the dominant noise sources at the tailsection of the CM. The objectives of the work presented in this paper were: 1) To rank the noise radiated by the different sections of the conveyor, and 2) to determine the effect of a urethane-coated tail roller on the noise radiated by the tail-section. This test was conducted using an Acoustical and Vibrations Engineering Consultants (AVEC) 3.5-m diameter, 121-microphone phased array. The results from this new test show that a urethane-coated tail roller yields reductions in the tail-section of 2 to 8 dB in Sound Pressure Level in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 5 kHz. However, integration of the acoustic maps shows that the front-section and mid-section of the conveyor also contain dominant noise sources. Therefore, a urethane-coated tail roller in combination with a chain with urethane-coated flights that reduces the noise sources in the front and mid sections of the conveyor is required to yield a significant noise reduction on the CM operator's overall exposure. These results show the applicability of phased array technology for low frequency noise source identification.},

  Abstract                 = {When applying acoustical imaging techniques of wave fields produced by sources in arbitrary, high-speed motion and sampled by a fixed microphone array, it is necessary to de-dopplerise the microphone signals. A careful examination of the related literature reveals a confusion when applying Doppler formulation in term of sound pressure to a monopole source. The aim of this paper is first to carefully detail the analytical and explicit developments of the Doppler effect in term of acoustic pressure for the general case of a density distribution source in a non-uniform and non-rectilinear motion. In the case of arbitrary motion, Lorentz transform is unapplicable and Green’s function procedure seems to be the only mathematical tool. An original vectorial closed-form expression of Doppler effect in time-domain has been obtained. The acoustic pressure radiated by a moving monopole has been simulated. Back and forth propagations with other Green functions presented in the literature highlight the impact of the source signal de-dopplerisation on the recovered amplitude. The transfer function introduced in this paper is applied to Delay-And-Sum Beamforming. Although, with respect to the implemented methods, the localisation performances are unchanged. A significant effect on the amplitude is shown and studied with respect to different motion parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The output of an array of sansors is considered to be a homogeneous random field. In this case there is a spectral representation for this field, similar to that for stationary random processes, which consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated.}

  Abstract                 = {The ability to perform aeroacoustic measurements in hard-walled, closed section wind tunnels is desirable for the development of quiet aircraft, to supplement dedicated acoustic testing in open-jet anechoic facilities. One of the restrictions of such testing is the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when using arrays of microphones mounted on the wind tunnel wall. This can limit the ability to discern acoustic sources which are near, or below, the background noise level of the facility. Increasing the number of sensors can help to improve SNR. In this paper we investigate how sensor mounting details can help to improve SNR. A systematic study of microphone mounting strategies is presented. The performance of individual microphone recessing, using straight and countersunk holes, is investigated and compared with flush-mounted microphone performance. The effects of placing the microphones out of the flow by recessing the whole array behind a cloth are described. A parametric study of the effect of recess depth and cloth type has been carried out, along with the effect of adding an acoustic foam liner within the recess enclosure. Results show that recessing individual microphones by the depth of the microphone diameter (d) up to 2d can provide up to 3dB improvement. Increasing the recess depth beyond 2d provided up to 10dB improvement, with recessing to 10d depth providing up to 20dB improvement. The greatest improvements occur below 25kHz, although there is improvement across the 0 to 48kHz range. The effect of countersunk recessing was either no improvement, or an increase in the background noise level of up to 20dB, possibly due to cavity mode oscillations within the recess aperture. Significant differences in SNR were observed between Kevlar cloths of different densities, and with a silk covering. A reduction in background noise level of 5 to 10dB was observed when acoustic foam lining was added to the floor of the recessed array. Overall this study concludes that the use of recessed arrays with acoustic foam lining may significantly improve microphone array SNR in hard-walled wind tunnel testing.},

  Abstract                 = {Identification of interior noise sources during flight tests becomes a necessary step in aircraft industry to improve acoustic comfort. In the case of the cabin, it can be interesting to use mobile tools such as microphones rackets to explore all corners. In many other cases, a static tool can be more efficient, for example where access is prohibited during flight, when sources are transient, or when successive flight configurations are compared. For several years Airbus and MicrodB have developed a spherical rigid antenna. It was used in trouble shooting activity and gave good results in presence of complex acoustic
field thanks to favourable scattering effect on the sphere. In order to improve at same time detection performance and ability to be used in difficult access areas, Airbus and MicrodB recently developed a new tool, based on a multi-antenna concept. It is composed of a smaller spherical antenna and extension arms. Beamforming treatments had to be adapted to this special microphones layout. Different methods were explored in order to evaluate true levels of localized sources for the different types of sources encountered and their degree of correlation. This tool was recently tested in flight and produced promising results.},

This analysis was performed using a Type B approach based on an analytical model according to the ISO Guide of the expression of uncertainty in measurement and subsequently using a numerical model based on Monte Carlo simulation. Systematic errors due to deviations of input parameters (e.g. speed of sound or source–array distance), affecting output level and spatial accuracy have been analysed. Once these inaccuracies were quantified, suggestions to minimize them were given. Finally a criterion to optimize focussing of the beamforming technique based on acoustic image contrast maximization has been developed.},

In the case of multiple sources, an alternating projection procedure is applied to determine the ML estimate of the DOAs from the observed data. The ML estimator is shown to be eﬀective in locating sound sources of various types, for example, vehicle, music, and even white noise. From the theoretical Cramér-Rao bound analysis, we ﬁnd that better source location estimates can be obtained for high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals. In addition, large range estimation error results when the source signal is unknown, but such unknown parameter does not have much impact on angle estimation. Much experimentally measured acoustic data was used to verify the proposed algorithms.},

In this paper, our main contribution is to propose to use 2D convolution model for fast acoustic imaging. We find out that power propagation matrix seems to be a quasi-Symmetric Toeplitz Block Toeplitz (STBT) matrix in the far-field condition, so that the (in)variant convolution kernels (sizes and values) can be well derived from this STBT matrix.

  Abstract                 = {Recently deconvolution-based methods, like the DAMAS, have greatly improved spatial resolutions of the Beamforming in aeroacoustic imaging. But most of existing methods are not robust to background noise. In this paper, we propose two robust super-resolution approaches using Sparsity Constraint (SC-RDAMAS) and Sparse Regularisation (SR-RDAMAS) respectively to simultaneously estimate source powers and positions, and the variance of background noise. In proposed SC-RDAMAS, sparsity constraint on source power is obtained by considering eigenvalue distributions of observed covariance matrix. When sparsity constraint is hard to determine in strong noise interference, proposed SR-RDAMAS applying ℓ1 regularisation with proper regularisation parameter can greatly improve resolutions and robustness of proposed SC-RDAMAS. Moreover, proposed SC-RDAMAS can work well even if the source number is over-estimated, but our SR-RDAMAS does not require source number at all. Proposed methods are shown to be robust to noise, wide dynamic range, super resolution and feasibility to use for near-field wideband extended source imaging based on 2D non-uniform microphone array by simulated and wind tunnel data. Our methods are compared with the state-of-art methods: Beamforming, DAMAS, Diagonal Removal DAMAS, DAMAS with sparsity constraint, Covariance Matrix Fitting and CLEAN.},

Beamforming main disadvantages are a poor spatial resolution, at low frequency, and the spatial aliasing problem, at higher frequency, leading to the identification of false sources. The idea is to move the microphone array during the measurement operation. In this paper, the proposed approach is theoretically and numerically investigated by means of simple sound propagation models, proving its efficiency in reducing the spatial aliasing. A number of different array configurations are numerically investigated together with the most important parameters governing this measurement technique. A set of numerical results concerning the case of a planar rotating array is shown, together with a first experimental validation of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {Wind tunnels are frequently used in the experimental study of moving sound sources. Although a number of techniques are currently used to determine the radiation characteristics of a sound source in a wind tunnel, they are usually limited by a lack of explicit directional information and/or a requirement that measurements be made in a free field. The multiple microphone acoustic intensity technique provides explicit directional information and can be used to measure sound fields in the near field of a source and, therefore, represents a possible alternative to the current measurement techniques used in wind tunnels. The formulations currently used to measure acoustic intensity are limited to either zero flow or plane waves in a one-dimensional mean flow. A new formulation has been developed that extends the method to the case of a spherically spreading wave in a uniform one-dimensional flow. Using an analytical simulation, the intensity distributions for a monopole and dipole source are studied. Initial results suggest that the formulation is suitable for the analysis of compact sources. Although a more detailed study will be required to develop a practical measurement tool, this study provides additional insight into the problem of intensity measurement in the presence of mean flow.}

All serrated airfoils yield reduced trailing-edge noise levels, the reductions ranging from 3 dB up to 8 dB. Spectral shape and dependency on the flow speed and angle-of-attack appeared to be different for every airfoil type. The serrated flat plates were found to give reductions up to 10 dB (1 kHz - 6 kHz). Inclination of the complete flat plate by 10 degrees or a swept trailing edge affected this reduction to a very limited extend only (<2 dB). The same holds for a 10 degrees misalignment of the teeth with respect to the flow direction but in the chord plane. However, misalignment of the teeth by 15 degrees with respect to the chord plane caused an increase of the radiated noise.},

Near-field/farfield correlations have been performed in order to study the spectral shape of these sources, completed in high frequencies with the analysis of the signals of flush mounted transducers. Different behavior were exhibited between low and high frequency range, for the wing leading edge noise and in the slotted flap region.

  Abstract                 = {To identify multiple duct acoustic modes, the L1 generalized inverse beam-forming algorithm is applied to phased-array pressure data. This algorithm has been proven to detect multipole modes regardless of their coherency in previous studies. A tone signal of a prescribed mode or broadband signal is generated upstream of a curved rectangular duct, and acoustic fields formed in both upstream and downstream stations of the test section are measured with identical wall-mounted microphone arrays. Amplitude distributions of several horizontal and vertical modes including upstream- and downstream-propagating waves can be identified, and the results are compared with those processed with conventional beam-forming. The comparison using synthetic data demonstrates that the L1 generalized inverse beam-forming approach can substantially suppress undesirable noise levels regardless of the prescribed modes and the noise levels. The comparison using test data acquired in the curved duct test rig (CDTR) at the NASA Langley Research Center suggests that L1 generalized inverse beam-forming can improve the dynamic range of the detected mode by more than 10 dB relative to conventional beam-forming even with mean flow of M = 0.5.},

In the second part of the paper, a method is described that goes one step beyond source localization.

  Abstract                 = {Along with stricter noise regulations in aviation comes the requirement to identify and eliminate sources of noise in aerodynamic designs. For this purpose, a phased array and data acquisition system (acoustic camera) was designed and built by students of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of Delft University of Technology. The performance of the phased array and different beamforming algorithms is evaluated with a variety of test cases, representative for the experiments conducted in moderate size wind tunnels (models of 10 cm to 30 cm, working distance of 1 m to 2 m) as typically available in university aboratories. The considered test cases are rod-airfoil combinations, which produce low-frequency tonal noise. The scaled models are tested in an open jet non-anechoic vertical wind tunnel at flow speeds ranging from 15 m/s to 40 m/s. The experiments present several challenges, namely the low level of the emitted noise, the required high spatial resolution and the refraction of sound waves travelling through the shear layer. The study discusses the specific developments and optimization of the low-cost acoustic camera for use in the non-anechoic open jet wind tunnel of moderate size},

  Abstract                 = {Zeropadding is an approved method in signal processing to get additional samples or to suppress undesirable signals without changing essential signal properties. Beamforming in the frequency domain also uses zeropadding to transform the time signals into the frequency domain. The advantage of beamforming in the time domain compared with beamforming in frequency domain is the providing of high time resolution additional to positioning resolution (acoustical movie). But by use of high resolution in the time domain in combination with non stationary, impulse containing signals the delay and sum beamformer produces overlaps between acoustic events that are well separated in time domain. The analysis of short and small impulses can be complicate or impossible. An acoustic movie shows this overlays by apparently inversely moving patterns that can hide noise sources completely. This paper describes these moving patterns as an artifact of the delay and sum algorithm. Some examples show the limitations of spatio-temporally resolution. An enhanced algorithm using zeropadding suppresses the patterns and improves the spatio-temporally resolution considerably. A comparison of analyses with and without zeropadding shows the advantages of the enhanced algorithm. It enables new areas of applications, e.g. in architectural acoustics.},

This paper introduces a time domain beamforming algorithm based on the acoustic eraser algorithm . The algorithm provides an automatically, successively decomposition of the sound field with a high dynamic range. That allows contrast improvements up to 50 dB .

  Abstract                 = {A new beamforming algorithm is introduced. It is called Functional Beamforming because it uses the mathematics of functions of matrices. The algorithm depends on an exponent parameter. The array Cross Spectral Matrix is raised to the power of the reciprocal of this exponent in the functional sense. Conventional Frequency Domain Beamforming is applied using the modified CSM, and the values of the resulting beamform map are raised to power of the non-reciprocal exponent. For large values of the exponent, array sidelobes are essentially eliminated. This increases flexibility in array design and dramatically increases the dynamic range of the system so that new sources may be discovered. Theory is given that proves that the method will not eliminate or even reduce true sources if the steering vector is accurate. This depends on the quality the array calibration, but the requirements are not extraordinary. Examples are given comparing the method with Robust Adaptive Beamforming, CLEAN-SC, Orthogonal Beamforming, and to some degree, Linear Programming. A previously unknown noise source of Boeing 747 desk models is shown.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of a porous layer, such as foam rubber, over a phased array is proposed to reduce background noise in wind tunnel acoustic measurements. As previous work has shown, this reduces boundary layer noise by displacing the flow from the array by the thickness of the layer. The new idea is that it can also reduce the impact of noise from the wind tunnel drive system and other flow control features because that noise appears to originate from far away in the wind tunnel, usually upstream. Due to its oblique incidence on the porous layer, the interfering noise sees more transmission loss in passing through the layer than the sound from the model does. A disadvantage of such a layer is that the attenuation can increase rapidly with frequency, possibly complicating the interpretation of the data. Shop tests of several materials have been performed. It is observed that viscoelastic "memory foam” has lower and more linear attenuation than the other samples tested. Elements of the shop results have been validated in a wind tunnel test.},

DAMAS is an iterative non-negative least squares solver. The original algorithm is too slow and lacks an explicit regularization method to prevent noise amplification. Two extensions are proposed, DAMAS2 and DAMAS3. DAMAS2 provides a dramatic speedup of each iteration and adds regularization by a low pass filter. DAMAS3 also provides fast iterations, and additionally, reduces the required number of iterations. It uses a different regularization technique from DAMAS2, and is partially based on the Wiener filter. Both DAMAS2 and DAMAS3 restrict the point spread function to a translationally-invariant, convolutional, form. This is a common assumption in optics and radio astronomy, but may be a serious limitation in aeroacoustic beamforming. This limitation is addressed with a change of variables from (x,y,z) to a new set, (u,v,w). The concepts taken together, along with appropriate array design, may permit practical 3D beamforming in aeroacoustics.},

  Abstract                 = {Aeroacoustic phased array and mirror microphones are known to suffer a loss of sensitivity due to passage of the sound waves through the wind tunnel shear layer or boundary layer. It is common practice to use smaller arrays than might otherwise be desired in order to limit this effect. A quantitative model of the scattering and its impact on the results would permit improved array designs and increase the accuracy of the spectra from these tests. A well developed formalism for wave propagation in random media supports the astronomical, underwater acoustics, and especially the atmospheric science fields. Initial steps have been taken to apply the this theory to the aeroacoustic phased array domain. An expression of the von Kármán turbulence model in the parabolic and Markov approximations has been adapted for phased array beamforming in open and closed wind tunnels. A simple formula for the effect of turbulence on the beamforming peak level has been derived. The theory and previous experimental work suggest correlation based on Mδ/λ. The effect of array diameter on the turbulence scattering is predicted. If the diameter exceeds several times the boundary layer thickness, then further increases in size should not change the scattering. Comparisons with measurements show good agreement in some cases, but not all. A need for more detailed investigation of hot wire data from wind
tunnel shear and boundary layers and more complete numerical simulations has been recognized.},

In the last 10 years, advancements in sparse 2-D and 3-D arrays, wind tunnel test techniques, and computer power have made phased array measurements almost common. Large aerospace companies and national research institutes have an advantage in access to major facilities and hundreds of measurement microphones, but universities and even consulting companies can perform tests with electret microphones and PC data acquisition systems. The type of testing remains a blend of science and art. A complex noise source is approximated by a mathematical model, and the microphones are deployed to evaluate the parameters of the model. For example, the simplest, but often the best, approach is to assume a distribution of mutually incoherent monopoles. This leads to an imaging process analogous to photography. Other models include coherent distributions of multipoles or duct modes. It is sometimes important to simulate the results that would have been obtained from single microphone measurements of part of the airplane in an ideal environment, had such measurements been feasible.}

  Abstract                 = {Beamforming in reverberant environments is important to locate and quantify noise sources in turbofan engine nacelles, automobile interiors, factories, and architectural settings. In order to validate and explore the limits of this approach, a beamforming experiment was conducted in a reverberation chamber using a 32 channel planar phased array and B&K sound power source. In the reference configuration, the source was located 2 m from the 1.1 m diameter array, and neither was close to the chamber walls. A less-demanding case was constructed by adding some foam absorber to the room to reduce reverberation. A difficult case resulted when the source was placed 5 m from the array, about 1 m from a corner of the chamber. Conventional frequency-domain beamforming with diagonal deletion was applied. The sound source was accurately located at the 2 m distance, with and without the added absorber. In the 5 m case, the sound source could be located at only a few frequencies and only when the processing bandwidth was increased from 48.8 Hz to 781 Hz. Processing individual eigenvectors of the CSM separated the direct and reflected source in 5 m case. The error in the deduced broadband sound power was 0.72 dB in the baseline case, 1.47 dB with the added absorber, and 5.41 dB with the speaker in the corner. Application of CLEAN-SC did not improve the accuracy of the corner results. Use of a Green’s function that attempts to account for reflections was ineffective. It is concluded that beamforming in highly reverberant environment with the free space Green’s function is practical, provided the array is designed and positioned correctly for the environment and source location.},

CLEAN-SC is found to be a powerful enhancement for mode measurements, completely removing several types of array artifacts and facilitating reliable sound power estimates. An interesting feature of CLEANSC is that the resulting mode map potentially combines the powers of several modes into a single spot.

The polar array consisted of the standard 32 5° microphones covering inlet angles from 5° through 160°, and the “high frequency” array comprised 23 microphones nonuniformly spaced over 60° through 90°. All of the microphones were spaced 100 feet from a point below the engine inlet highlight on the tarmac. The primary objectives were to separate source components and to determine the feasibility of beamforming with the standard microphones. An unexpected case-radiation source was identified and characterized. Conventional beamforming as well as DAMAS and CLEAN-SC were applied. It was found that CLEAN-SC is a powerful tool for reducing sidelobes, dealing with coherent sources, and mitigating the effects of turbulent decorrelation, all of which are important in this application.},

  Abstract                 = {A one-inch diameter cold jet at the NASA-Glenn Research Center was studied with a Rayleigh scattering technique to measure the unsteady density in selected probe volume locations and, simultaneously, with a phased array of 32 microphones arranged in a partial cylinder that was centered on the jet and the probe volume. Phased array beamforming was performed to visualize the jet noise sources and test the effect of ray tracing for array steering and the DAMAS2 deconvolution technique. Correlation coefficients between the microphone signals and between the acoustic data and the unsteady density from the Rayleigh probe were examined. The primary goal was to determine whether the array would increase the correlation coefficient relative to previous work in which the unsteady density from the Rayleigh system was correlated with the output of individual microphones. Results are presented for the case of M = 0.95. Increased correlation was observed, but, contrary to expectations, the optimal array steering points were not coincident with the probe volume. At low frequency, the highest correlation coefficient was seen when then array was steered upstream of the probe volume . At high frequency, significant correlation between the microphones and the de nsity occurred only when the probe volume was in the jet shear layer. In this case, the delay between the density signal and the acoustic pressure was negative, i.e., the density fluctuations in the probe volume lagged the pressure waves at the microphones. The optimal array steering point in this case was downstream of the probe volume, and coincided with peak acoustic source region seen in beamforming with array by itself.},

  Abstract                 = {Phased array test techniques are becoming increasingly popular in aeroacoustics. This is due, in part, to the use of optimized array designs (e.g., spiral shapes) which can operate over usefully wide frequency ranges with acceptable resolution and sidelobe rejection characteristics with practical numbers of microphones. Sometimes constraints such as limited space for microphone installation prevent the use of optimum array designs, raising the prospect of high sidelobe levels. Several modifications to classical beamforming which may reduce sidelobe levels for imperfect arrays (and possibly improve the performance of optimized arrays) are available. The effectiveness of these techniques is explored by applying three of them to four array designs using simulated wind tunnel data. The three bearnforrning techniques are robust adaptive beamforming, cross spectral matrix element weighting, and the CLEAN algorithm. The array designs are a cross, an array of four crosses, a filled square, and a spiral array},

A phased array consisting of one or more rings of microphones is employed. Thedata are mathematically resampled to a frame of reference rotating with the fan and subsequently used in a conventional beamforming technique in the rotating frame. The steering vectors for the beamforming are derived from annular duct modes, so that effects of reflections from the duct walls are reduced. In contrast with other work, the steering vectors represent the effect of the unsteady pressure at the fan, rather than the Green’s function. This improves the condition of the formulation and provides a connection to analytical studies. The method has been tested by applying it to data from the NASA-Glenn ANCF rig. The test included a condition in which two of the fan blades were altered to create noise sources at known locations.

NASA’s Wake Vortex Avoidance Project has a goal to establish the feasibility of reducing this spacing while maintaining safety. Passive acoustic phased array sensors, if shown to have operational potential, may aid in this effort by detecting and tracking the vortices. During August/September 2003, NASA and the USDOT sponsored a wake acoustics test at the Denver International Airport. The central instrument of the test was a large microphone phased array. This paper describes the test in general terms and gives an overview of the array hardware. It outlines one of the analysis techniques that is being applied to the data and gives sample results. The technique is able to clearly resolve the wake vortices of landing aircraft and measure their separation, height, and sinking rate. These observations permit an indirect estimate of the vortex circulation. The array also provides visualization of the vortex evolution, including the Crow instability.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic array measurements have been carried out in a wind tunnel with a closed test-section on a swept constant-chord half-model. The experiments show that strong background noise present in the test section disturbs the array measurements and causes artefacts in source maps obtained with conventional beamforming (CB). By analyzing the components of the wavenumber spectrum in the array plane using the delay-and-sum beamforming with an infinite focal distance it is shown that this noise consists mainly of upstream propagating spurious waves. They can be reduced either by modifications to the wind tunnel test-section or by the BiCLean algorithm, a more advanced array processing technique. In a second step the robustness of deconvolution algorithms is investigated with respect to the noisy data obtained from the closed test-section measurements. The new deconvolution algorithms E-DAMAS2 proposed by Ehrenfried and Koop and the CLEAN-SC algorithm introduced by Sijtsma are applied to the present experimental data. The results show that the spatial resolution can be increased considerably by applying these algorithms and that side lobes are successful suppressed. The integrated spectra obtained from the deconvolution source-powers agree very well with standard source-power integration results based on CB. The background noise which is present in the CB results is detected also with the deconvolution algorithms. But no instabilities have been observed in the deconvolution process due to this noise.},

Problems can arise from reflections at the hard side walls, the flow about the microphones, and background noise which propagates through the wind tunnel. To investigate the latter effect, array measurements are carried out in the large wind tunnel of the Hermann-Föttinger-Institute at the TU Berlin. This wind tunnel has a closed test section with a size of 2 m by 1.4 m. A microphone array is mounted at one side wall in the test section. The array has a diameter of about 1m and consists of 144 microphones. Experiments are done at flow velocities of 30 m/s with a wing model installed. The tests show that the background noise which is present in the test section has a characteristic wavenumber spectrum. Typically stronger waves are found which propagate in upstream direction. Their signals can cause strange artifacts in the source maps at focus points downstream of the array. A method is proposed to reduce these artifacts by a more sophisticated array evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {Compressed air energy is expensive, but common in industrial manufacturing plant. However, up to 30% of the generated compressed air energy is lost due to leakage. Best practice requires ongoing leak detection and repair. Leak detection in the ultrasonic frequency range using hand held devices is possible only over short distances as associated high-frequency waves with do not propagate well. Pressurized air escaping to ambient also generates frequencies below 20kHz. In this paper, beamforming in the audible frequency range is tested as a tool for localization of compressed air leaks at larger distances. Both advanced time and frequency domain beamforming methods have been implemented in a variety of situations on a laboratory experimental rig with several open blows representing leakage in a noisy environment typical of a factory setting. The advanced time domain broadband beamformer gives clearer initial noise maps than narrowband frequency domain approach as the broadband nature of the leakage is better exploited. The advanced beamforming in frequency domain is more effective in spatial resolution. Based on these initial results it is concluded that the microphone array approach has the potential to be a robust leak identification tool},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates how the trailing-edge noise mechanism is affected by manipulation of the turbulent boundary layer by means of suction and blowing. By manipulating the boundary layer (the noise source) and determining the effect on trailing-edge noise, better understanding of the trailing-edge noise generation mechanism can be gained. A 0.5 m chord, 0.585 m span NACA 0012 aerofoil was tested on an acoustically treated open-jet wind tunnel. Changeable plates were used on a hollow trailing-edge to allow suction and blowing manipulation of the boundary layer near the trailing-edge. Suction/blowing was achieved using an industrial vacuum/blower with an inline acoustic silencer to minimize noise contamination due to the vacuum/blower. Acoustic measurements were obtained using a Brüel & Kjær 60-channel sector-wheel-array suited for both beamforming and acoustic holography measurements. The two acoustic measurement techniques, were used to obtain measurements over the frequency range of interest for trailing-edge noise. Hotwire anemometry was used for aerodynamic measurements of the boundary layer noise source. The results in this paper detail: 1) the effect on trailing-edge noise of the different trailing-edge plate geometries 2) the effect on trailing-edge noise of manipulating the boundary layer using suction and blowing 3) the aerodynamic effect of suction and blowing on the boundary layer velocity fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {Noise emissions from aircraft are of major concern to aircraft manufacturers. There are various analytical, empirical and numerical tools to help in the design of quieter aircraft, however aeroacoustic measurements in wind tunnels are still required. There is a growing interest in simultaneous aerodynamic and aeroacoustic measurements in hard-walled closed-section wind tunnels. The research hypothesis of this work is whether accurate aeroacoustic measurements are possible in this type of wind tunnel. Two issues are of particular concern: the reverberation sound field and high background noise levels. De-reverberation, based on an Image Source Model (ISM), is proposed to tackle the first issue by incorporating the reflections in the focused beamformer. This technique is computationally fast and easy to implement. Source Power Integration and deconvolution techniques are shown to be still valid in de-reverberation. Measurements in a closed section wind tunnel have shown that an ISM gives a better estimate of the Green's functions, when compared to free-space Green's functions. Furthermore de-reverberation yielded more accurate source strength estimates from the beamformer. Qualitatively, de-convolved results were no different than when using free-space Green's functions. Simulations have shown that the ISM can become unstable at high frequencies if position errors are present. It is therefore recommended to limit the application of the ISM to frequencies below 10 kHz. At low frequencies the accuracy of beamforming levels is highly dependent on the level of noise contamination of the input data. Removing the diagonal of the cross spectral matrix might not be sufficient to eliminate this noise.},

The use of microphone arrays and beamforming processing can yield useful source localisation information, but there are concerns as to the consistency of quantitative results from such methods. Most of the limitations are due to the assumption of uncorrelated monopoles having uniform spherical directivity patterns. However there are other effects, such as the acoustic properties of the measuring environment and the position of the source with respect to nearby rigid boundaries. These effects are investigated in this paper using a calibration source with a known sound power level. It was found that the errors in the beamformer levels are frequency dependent, and also depend on the position of the source with respect to nearby boundaries. An image source model can give improvements in the beamformer accuracy, however the frequency-dependence of the errors could only be minimised by using measured transfer functions.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to perform aeroacoustic measurements in closed-section wind tunnels is important in vehicle design, but presents signi¯cant problems compared with anechoic open-jet tunnel testing. The use of microphone arrays and beamforming processing can yield useful source localisation information, but there are concerns as to the consistency of quantitative results from such methods. In this paper some of the de¯ciencies of current beamforming practice are highlighted; in particular, inaccuracies in levels arising from the reverberant sound ¯eld in hard-walled wind tunnels. Notably, the use of free-space Green's functions when beamforming in such conditions is shown to be a signi¯cant source of error, and an image source method is proposed to improve accuracy by de-reverberating the measuring environment. Comparisons are made between the conventional and proposed approaches using microphone array measurements of a compact source in a closed section wind tunnel. Results show that the new de-reverberation method can give improvements in accuracy even if the wind tunnel geometry is not modelled accurately, provided that the number of image sources is chosen correctly. The results also highlight the significant challenges associated with Green's functions measurements in highly-reverberant environments.},

It is demonstrated that measurements of the cross power spectral density of signals from such an array can be employed to obtain both the location and relative strengths of an axially distributed array of sound sources, for any frequency of interest. For the modern generation of high by-pass ratio engine this might include a measurement of the relative contribution to the far field noise emanating from the fan inlet, by-pass duct and hot core exhaust as well as indicating that portion of the jet flow which is the principal contributor to the frequency considered. The potential of this method is illustrated by examples of test results for full size jet engines and model jets.

  Abstract                 = {The measurement of the relative contributions to the acoustic field made by a set of sources, which by necessity must operate simultaneously, is of importance in many areas of noise control technology. A partial solution to this problem, proposed in the 1970s, was the Polar Correlation Technique. This recognized, initially, the Fourier transform relationship between cross-spectra, measured in the acoustic far field, and the distribution of source strength of a line array of sources, typical of an aero-engine, for example. In a second development (1981) a parametric method was developed. Essentially, the position of the contributing sources was assumed to be known and a least squares error procedure was employed to establish an optimum fit between the source strength distribution and the cross-spectral data. A major restriction, however, was the necessary assumption of mutually incoherent sources. In the present work it is demonstrated that this restriction is unnecessary, albeit at the expense of some extra data processing. Specifically, we show that by employing several reference microphones, as opposed to one for incoherent sources, both the amplitude of and coherence between an array of sources may be determined. The potential capability of the method is established both analytically and through extensive numerical simulation.},

A test campaign has been conducted in the ONERA F2 1.4 m × 1.8 m wind tunnel to investigate the performance of thin and smooth metallic clothes to protect the microphones from the hydrodynamic ﬂuctuations in the turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow and, still, to preserve the transmitted acoustic signal. Three microphone mountings have been considered : individually recessed microphones in (i) cylindrical and (ii) conical apertures and (iii) a recessed, screened, large-scale micro-phone mounting plate (microphones ﬂush with the plate). It was found that by covering the top of the cylindrical and conical microphone apertures with a wire-mesh, the strong self-noise due to the interaction of the boundary-layer ﬂow with the cavities can be suppressed. The most signiﬁcant noise reduction is obtained when the large-scale microphone mounting plate is recessed behind the metallic wire-mesh. A reduction by up to 20 dB is then obtained with respect to a ﬂush-mounted, unscreened, microphone. This microphone mounting out-performs the cone-nose-protected and Kevlar-protected microphone mountings, two conventional low-noise devices. Thanks to an original calibration technique, the acoustic response of the tested microphone mountings could be evaluated in presence of ﬂow (≤ 80 m/s). The recessed, screened, microphone mounting plate has an oscillating acoustic response (in function of the frequency) by less than 5 dB deviation. This attenuation can be post-corrected by using a very simple acoustic model.},

The originality of the approach is that it uses a recent beamforming-based deconvolution technique. The main interest of the method is to spatially separate the various airframe noise sources and to provide their individual de-Dopplerized acoustic levels over a range of more than 10 dB. Slat noise spectra and directivity patterns are computed for two flight velocities, 150 kts and 175 kts. The obtained results are in good agreement with the prediction from the slat noise model of Dobrzynski & Pott-Pollenske [AIAA paper 2001-2158].

  Abstract                 = {It is known that multiplicative processing of signals from receiver arrays can be used to obtain increased resolution for target identification where the target signal is strong in relation to extraneous noise. Sound source location in jet engines requires resolution of the order of a wavelength where the source region may have high directionality and several types of sound sources may interact. There is an analogy between target identification and the location of sound sources in jet engines where the extent of sources is not great on a wavelength scale. A theory for multiplicative processing of signals from two sub-arrays is developed for the case of a line source of generally correlated sound radiators which share the measurable far-field properties of a real jet engine. The real part of the cross-spectrum of the sub-array signals is used as an estimator of frequency dependent sound source intensity and results are compared with their equivalents for additive processing. The method has been implemented on a mini-computer and used for studies on full-size jet engines. Some typical results are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Jet noise source identification and location is still an important issue since no really conclusive or generally accepted description of the noise generation processes in turbulent jets has been achieved to data. While there is a definite need for a better understanding of jet mixing noise, one may question if far field approaches via acoustic mirror, telescope, or polar correlation techniques can provide the missing information. There are not only limitations in the spatial resolution which restrict these techniques to jet noise at the higher Strouhal and Mach numbers but also more fundamental difficulties in the interpretation of measured “equivalent source strength density distributions”. In particular, if large scale coherent turbulence structures participate in jet noise generation the assumption of a uniform amplitude and phase of the pressure field radiated from compact elements of this distribution is questionable. It is shown that various acoustic interference mechanisms due to mere source coherence and specific source structure effects may cause “mislocation” of sources in a jet. Some of these objections are less valid at the lower Helmholtz numbers but for these, unfortunately, the spatial resolution of all three techniques becomes poor. Since interpretation of source location results depends on a specific model of the jet noise sources it appears to be very difficult to gain from these three techniques a new insight into the problem for the relevant jet flow parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved version of the inverse source location method SODIX is presented. SODIX models broadband noise sources with a set of directive point sources by minimizing the difference between a measured and a simulated cross-spectral matrix of microphone signals. One big advantage of the method in comparison to other source location methods is, that it calculates a directive source strength from each point source towards each microphone. The new version of SODIX includes an implicit consideration of the constraint of positive source strengths in the iteration process. This improvement made the optimization process more stable and in addition independent of the initially assume source distribution. The method is also extended for applications with multidimensional source and microphone arrangements. Further, it is shown that the main diagonal of the cross-spectral matrix can be removed from the calculations without any mathematical violations and that the absolute strengths of the dominating sources are preserved. The improvements of the method are shown with exemplary results using measured data from a static aeroengine freefield test.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a technique which relates dynamic pressure measurements taken outside the hydrodynamic ﬁeld of a low speed jet to single point, one component velocity measurements taken within the jet using a Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system. To improve the signal to noise ratio of the pressure measurement, a coherence based acoustic beamforming technique is applied and focussed on the LDV measurement volume in order to evaluate its contribution to the measured sound. As the pressure samples are acquired at regular time steps whereas the velocity at irregular time intervals dependent on the particle seeding, the calculation of the auto- and cross-spectra of the pressure and velocity measurements require special treatment. The signal processing procedures required to calculate these are described and implemented in the paper. To validate the proposed technique real experimental data was analysed. Laser Doppler Velocimetry measured velocity ﬂuctuations created by rods placed in a jet. Synchronously, a planar random array focused on the same plane as the LDV measurement, measured pressure ﬂuctuation outside the hydrodynamic ﬁeld. The same set of data was then analysed using conventional and coherence based beamforming algorithms. The results from both techniques were compared. While conventional beamforming identiﬁed the contribution from the main sources within the ﬂow, the coherence based method was able to single out the source related to the local measurement. The results shown demonstrated how coherence based beamforming, combined with LDV, can be a useful tool for aeroacoustic noise source investigations.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic imaging aims at localization and characterization of sound sources using microphone arrays. In this paper a new regularization method for acoustic imaging by inverse approach is proposed. The method first relies on the singular value decomposition of the plant matrix and on the projection of the measured data on the corresponding singular vectors. In place of regularization using classical methods such as truncated singular value decomposition and Tikhonov regularization, the proposed method involves the direct definition of the filter factors on the basis of a thresholding operation, defined from the estimated measurement noise. The thresholding operation is achieved using modified filter functions. The originality of the approach is to propose the definition of a filter factor which provides more damping to the singular components dominated by noise than that given by the Tikhonov filter. This has the advantage of potentially simplifying the selection of the best regularization amount in inverse problems. Theoretical results show that this method is comparatively more accurate than Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition.},

Nowadays, urban placements have to be avoided because their background noise has a great influence on the measurements made by sound level meters or single microphones. Because of the small device size and low number of microphones (that make it so easy to set up), the resolution of the device is not high enough to provide a clean aircraft noise time history by only applying frequency domain beamforming to the spatial cross-correlations of the microphones’ signals. Therefore, a new step to the processing algorithm has been added to eliminate this handicap.},

  Abstract                 = {Beamforming is a signal processing technique that uses the combined signal from an array of sensors as a spatial filter to locate sound sources. The method is established both in underwater acoustics and in seismological applications. The current project is intended to determine the feasibility of beamformer technology in atmospheric acoustics. The microphone array, data collection, and signal processing technologies are discussed. The signal processing method is the maximum-likelihood estimate algorithm in conjunction with eigenvalue decomposition. Input data are block averaged and filtered adaptively to reduce the effect of noise. Analysis is performed in the frequency domain. Field data have been obtained for stationary, as well as moving sound sources. Work to date indicates that stationary sources can be located and single moving sources can be tracked with adequate resolution using the beamformer. Multiple targets at the same frequency are misidentified as one source located at a position amid the sources. This may be due to the excessive
beamwidth that results when microphone spacing is small in comparison to the sound wavelength. At the other extreme, as the microphone spacing becomes large compared to the wavelenglh, spatial aliasing occurs. Thus, it is necessary to size the sensor array according to the expected range of frequencies of the source. Block averaging and adaptive filtering in the signal processing eliminate many false source indications. Current research concentrates on implementing further improvements in the signal processing to enhance resolution. and reduce the effects of noise.},

The objective of the research is the analysis of the turbulent boundary layer properties of porous airfoils and, subsequently, of the noise generated at the trailing edge. The in fluence of the porous materials, characterized by their air flow resistivity, is discussed. The acoustic measurements were performed using a planar 56-channel microphone array and the boundary layer properties were measured using constant temperature anemometry. The recorded acoustic data underwent further processing by application of an advanced beamforming algorithm. A noticeable reduction of the emitted trailing edge noise was measured for the porous airfoils, especially at low and medium frequencies. At high frequencies, some of the porous airfoils were found to generate more noise than the reference airfoil which might be due to the surface roughness noise contribution. It is found that the turbulent boundary layer thickness and the boundary layer displacement thickness of the airfoils increase with decreasing flow resistivities for both suction and pressure side. Both boundary layer thickness and displacement thickness of the non-porous airfoil are below those of the porous airfoils.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper describes acoustic and hot-wire measurements that were done in the aeroacoustic wind tunnel at the Brandenburg Technical University of Cottbus on various SD7003-type airfoils made of different porous (fl ow permeable) materials. The objective of the research is the analysis of the turbulent boundary layer properties of porous airfoils and, subsequently, of the noise generated at the trailing edge. The in fluence of the porous materials, characterized by their air flow resistivity, is discussed. The acoustic measurements were performed using a planar 56-channel microphone array and the boundary layer properties were measured using constant temperature anemometry. The recorded acoustic data underwent further processing by application of an advanced beamforming algorithm. A noticeable reduction of the emitted trailing edge noise was measured for the porous airfoils, especially at low and medium frequencies. At high frequencies, some of the porous airfoils were found to generate more noise than the reference airfoil which might be due to the surface roughness noise contribution. It is found that the turbulent boundary layer thickness and the boundary layer displacement thickness of the airfoils increase with decreasing flow resistivities for both suction and pressure side. Both boundary layer thickness and displacement thickness of the non-porous airfoil are below those of the porous airfoils.},

  Abstract                 = {A measurement technique is described for the localization and visualization of noise sources on moving rail vehicles using beamforming. The Delay-And-Sum (DAS) beamforming, is often used on stationary (fixed) sources. However the method can also be applied to moving sources such as rail vehicles, road vehicles and aircraft fly-overs, as well as rotating blades on wind turbines. Recently, deconvolution techniques have been introduced as post-processing after DAS to improve the spatial resolution and reduce the level of ghost sources in the calculated noise maps. This paper describes a commercially available system which includes DAS and deconvolution techniques, dedicated to the rail vehicle industry. Special consideration is paid to the configuration of the test site and its influence on the measurement results. The advantages of various microphone array designs for measurements on bogies, rails and pantographs are discussed. Guidelines are given for the selection of an appropriate array (half-wheel, logarithmic wheel) for the source of interest and illustrated with practical results from noise emission measurements on regional trains.},

  Abstract                 = {Manufacturers of wind turbines often use simulation techniques such as Computational Fluid Dynamics to analyse noise radiation from the blades. Although simulations are very attractive during the design phase, they do not take all mechanisms from the real life into account, and therefore real measurements will also be necessary for validation during development. Beamforming is a measurement technique for decomposing the sound into directions of incidence. Measurements are performed with an array of microphones and the output is typically visualized as a contour plot showing the noise contribution on the surface of interest. In this paper a tracking beamforming approach is applied on an operating wind turbine. Knowing the position of the turbine and measuring the blade(s) azimuth angle, the focus points can follow the movement of the blades, and the noise map can be visualized on the blade(s) for each azimuth angle step. The array used for the measurements consists of 9 lines of microphones lying on the ground (flush mounted in rigid plates) with 12 microphones per line. On one of the blades there was a set of known source locations (whooshing sound from accelerometers mounted on the blade), and the results confirmed their locations.},

  Abstract                 = {The need for aircraft noise reduction is acknowledged worldwide. Acoustic cameras play an important role to identify aircraft noise sources. An acoustic camera tailored for aircraft noise was designed, built and tested by students of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of Delft University of Technology. The camera uses only 32 microphones, while still maintaining a high angular resolution. The design resulted in an acoustic camera tailored for measuring aircraft noise with a flexible array configuration and array aperture due to a clever mechanical construction. The system is easily transportable and has a short set up time (less than half an hour). The specifications of the acoustic camera are comparable to existing commercial ones. Various beamforming methods were implemented: conventional least-squares-based beamforming, Capon beamforming, the MUSIC algorithm and so-called CLEAN-PSF and CLEAN-SC. Due to its versatility, the camera can also be used for other applications, such as abatement of traffic and industrial noise and architectural and room acoustics. The developed acoustic camera was tested by measuring fly-over noise of landing aircraft. Despite its low cost design, the cameraproved to have the required angular resolution to clearly distinguish between engine and airframe noise},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an array measurement on the volcano Stromboli in the area of Sicilia in Italy. Eruptions of one of the calderas are characterized by a turbulent jet. So far volcanologists often use seismological equipment, but lately other technologies find their way into the volcanology and were used to describe the state of the volcano. As it is shown by numerical CFD-LES-simulations the distance of the shock-cells of supersonic jets vary with the Mach-number. The sound sources are shown by applying a beamforming algorithm and deconvolution methods (DAMAS2) with synthetic generated microphone data from the simulation. With the knowledge of the main source positions of the jet it is possible to identify the inner pressure beyond the nozzle. This paper presents the experimental setup and preliminary work to lay out the array. As the array setup is very much dependent on the local conditions which are found at the volcano, it is necessary to locate the microphone positions of the array ad-hoc at the caldera. Also first results of the measurements are presented. With further knowledge about the gas composition and the temperature of the jet it is possible to determine the Mach-number of the jet. The main aim of the measurement is to obtain more state information about the volcano.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we outline the developement of a system for speaker diarization within group meetings to prepare those for automatic speech recognition. Since the acceptance of headsets for group meeting recordings is very limited a more comfortable approach is to use beamforming and to steer an adaptive beamformer towards the person who is speaking. In our setup we used 5 room microphones plus 4 headsets providing reference signals for performance evaluations. Recordings of virtual group meetings with limited vocabulary were done. Choosing from a vocabulary of only 1700 words, multiple sentences were constructed which were then spontaneously used within the group meeting recordings. Our goal is to capture the dynamics of group meetings but with limited vocabulary to make robust automatic speech recognition feasible. We plan to combine two methods to prepare for speaker diarization, blind source separation and adaptive beamforming in combination with direction of arrival estimation for each speaker. In speaker diarization the goal is to ﬁnd the segments of time in which each meeting attendee is speaking. Time segments in which two or more speakers are speaking are especially challenging. We plan to use blind source separation in conjunction with an adaptive beamformer to steer towards all speakers simultaneously and achieve one audio recording per speaker.},

The analysis is based on acoustic dedopplerized spectra and localization maps calculated with the pressure signals of a phased array of 168 microphones. This study shows that the prediction of jet mixing noise collapses reasonably well with the measurements, a modal analysis of buzz-saw tones based on the farfield directivity gives results in agreement with the theory of buzz-saw tone generation, the amplitude of the blade passing frequency tone depends on the slat/flap settings and airspeed but not on the landing gear position. As outlook some preliminary results calculated with a source amplitude assessment method are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {A hybrid time-frequency approach based on acoustic beamforming has been successfully developed in order to determine the absolute contribution of the aircraft noise components measured during fly-overs. The method, derived from DAMAS accounts for the fact that the sources move relative to the microphones. Indeed, the motion is responsible for a frequency shift of the sidelobes and a strong modification of the point-spread functions compared to the static case. The method developed is hybrid in the sense that the beamforming algorithm is applied in the time domain while the point-spread functions are approximated in the frequency domain. When the sound sources are characterized by broadband spectra, it becomes possible to discard the frequency coupling between the sources and the sidelobes. This enables to reduce the computing time considerably. In the present publication, the method is applied to AIRBUS A340 fly-overs with the high-lift devices deployed, landing gear up, and the engines running at idle. The study is focused
on the influence of some processing parameters (grid spacing, number of iterations, cut of the focusing grid, and frequency bandwidth) on the source breakdown. It turns out that the noise spectra of the aircraft components are almost independent of reasonable variations of these parameters. This indicates that the method is relatively robust. A detailed investigation of the noise sources (flaps, slats, and engines) with respect to the variations of the airspeed, the ECAM position, the engine rating, etc. is not part of this work.},

While beamforming gives a qualitative information about the noise emission, the deconvolution method enables to quantify separately the level of the sources.

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic beamforming with microphone phased-arrays is a powerful method to investigate the noise emission of vehicles (aircraft, trains, cars, etc.). Per definition, the aerodynamic sound sources appear when these vehicles are in motion. Some of the sources, like the highlift devices of aircraft, are distributed in space. The beamforming patterns are the result of a convolution between the sources and point spread functions, which depend on the array geometry and source position. The performance of a phased array is characterised by two parameters: i) the beamwidth on which depends the capacity to separate two sources close to each other, and ii) the level of the side-lobes which describes the dynamic range. In static applications (the source positions are fixed with respect to the microphone array) the source strength of distributed sources can be determined by deconvoluting the beamforming solution. Some issues arise when a deconvolution is applied to moving sources because the frequencies of the side-lobes are shifted with respect to the main lobe. An approximate method for the deconvolution of the beampattern of moving broadband sources is derived and it is shown with simulated data that solutions can be obtained with a reasonable accuracy and computing time.},

  Abstract                 = {A problem for the classic beamforming approach is the limited dynamic range of the acoustic mapping. Louder sources are masking quieter sources. This limitation is valid for sources in the same frequency range. With multi band beamforming sources in different frequency ranges can be visualized with the only limitation being the dynamic range of the measurement system. Coherence filtering techniques allow for the distinction between incoherent sources and the detection of mirror sources. Here, the coherence between an additional sensor placed as reference close to the main source is used to filter the array signals increasing the overall dynamic of the acoustic source mapping. The real sensor can be replaced by a virtual sensor signal as result of the beamforming calculation allowing for a wider range of applications. Recent advantages in computer technologies allow for a real time processing of the microphone array data resulting in an online visualization of the sound sources.},

  Abstract                 = {Wind tunnels are used in combination with phased array techniques or elliptic mirrors to localize and quantify the aerodynamic noise coming e.g. from an airfoil or a high-lift device. Wind tunnels with a closed test section deliver good aerodynamic conditions but have often poor acoustic conditions due to reflections caused by the test section walls which decrease the resolution of phased arrays at low frequencies. In previous paper the authors presented an algorithm called reflection canceller (RC) which integrates the reflections in the beamforming process. In simulations and measurements without flow this algorithm showed a good spatial resolution that exspecially in the low frequencies was higher than using the classical beamforming algorithms under anechoic conditions. In this paper measurements in a closed test section wind tunnel are presented. With a point source integrated in a NACA-0020 profile the Green´s functions characterising the reverberating environment have been measured for different wind speeds. These functions are used to optimize the RC. In measurements with aerodynamic point sources the RC shows again an increased spatial resolution .},

  Abstract                 = {The paper tackles the problem of aerodynamic noise measurements in wind tunnels with an acoustically hard closed test section. Data processing based on phased array techniques like the Classical Beamformer often fails due to the reflections caused by the test section walls. In a previous paper the authors proposed a modification of the Classical Beamformer called Reflection Canceller. This algorithm incorporates the reflections caused by rectangular test section walls by expanding the steering vectors with mirror sources. This algorithm performed well in simulations and measurements in a reverberating chamber and showed even an increased spatial resolution compared to the anechoic environment. Before the Reflection Canceller is used in real wind tunnel measurements the algorithm, foremost its basic quantity, the steering vector, has to be validated with some basic experiments. For this the steering vector was measured using a monopole point source. This was done in two steps, (1) in a closed test section wind tunnel without flow to confirm the effect of increased spatial resolution and (2) in a nonreflecting environment wind tunnel with flow to compare the measured steering vectors with the modeled ones. This paper shows results from both experiments. The first one, performed in the Laminar Wind Tunnel at the University of Stuttgart, shows the predicted increased spatial resolution. The second one, performed in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel at the Technical University of Dresden, shows good agreement between measured and modeled steering vectors. Finally an algorithm is presented which allows to increase the performance of multiplexing DAQ-Cards for steady state sound fields.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper describes a commercially available fly-over beamforming system based on methodologies already published, but using an array that was designed for quick and precise deployment on a concrete runway rather than for minimum sidelobe level. Time domain tracking Delay And Sum (DAS) beamforming is the first processing step, followed by Deconvolution in the frequency domain to reduce sidelobes, enhance resolution, and get absolute scaling of the source maps. The system has been used for a series of fly-over measurements on a Business Jet type MU300 from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Results from a couple of these measurements are presented: Contribution spectra from selected areas on the aircraft to the sound pressure level at the array are compared against the total sound pressure spectrum measured by the array. One major aim of the paper is to verify that the system performs well although the array was designed with quick deployment as a main criterion. The results are very encouraging. A second aim is to elaborate on the handling of the array shading function in connection with the calculation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) used in deconvolution. Recent publications have used a simple formula to compensate for Doppler effects for the case of flat broadband spectra. A more correct formula is derived in the present paper, covering also a Doppler correction to be made in the shading function, when that function is used in the PSF calculation.},

  Abstract                 = {The fluctuating pressure field underneath a turbulent boundary layer can lead to excitation of the surface structure of airplanes, trains and cars. At high flow speeds, this excitation becomes a major noise source in the vehicle interior. In the past, the characteristics of this excitation have been measured by the DLR in wind tunnels and in flight tests. A beam forming technique using planar waves was used as wavenumber decomposition in order to analyze the pressure fluctuations present over an installed microphone array. The information contained in the wavenumber spectrum resulting from the analysis is essential when empirically modeling the excitation behavior of a surface exposed to a pressure field. Speed, direction, and propagation mechanism (acoustic or hydrodynamic) of pressure waves can be determined from the position of sources in the wavenumber domain. This makes the wavenumber decomposition a helpful tool for the characterization of source mechanisms. In this paper, a summary of the test results is given. The attributes and potential of the wavenumber decomposition are emphasized in particular.},

In this contribution, simulated as well as measured data of known source configurations are being evaluated using array-based methods like DAMAS, CLEAN, CLEAN-SC, Orthogonal Beamforming, and Covariance Matrix Fitting. The results obtained using these methods and varying several of their parameters will be compared. It will be shown that, in part, these results differ considerably in terms of calculated position and magnitude of the sound sources.

  Abstract                 = {The flow and acoustic fields of an ideally expanded Mach 1.3 axisymmetric jet with delta tabs were examined to explore the effects of the tabs on noise sources. This work continues research that was performed on a baseline (no-tab) jet. Noise measurements were made at an angle of 30° to the downstream jet axis to allow a direct comparison to previous work, and to relate the sound generation mechanisms to the large structures that were visualized with temporally resolved flow visualization. Additional acoustic measurements were made at 60˚ and 90˚ locations. Three cases were examined: a baseline jet, a single delta tab jet, and a dual delta tab jet. Both tab jets were operated at the same pressure ratio as the baseline jet, which was ideally expanded. Power spectra and average acoustic waveform measurements were made for a variety of azimuthal locations; apparent noise origins were estimated with a 3-D microphone array; and temporally resolved flow visualization was used to examine the dynamic flow structure of the jet's mixinglayer. The results confirm that the tabs generate strong streamwise vortices that have a significant effect on both the flow and acoustic fields of the jet. The tabs cause significant deformation in the cross-stream plane of the mixing-layer, as well as regulating the formation and roll-up of vortices due to Kelvin Helmholtz instability. With the addition of tabs, the noise field becomes azimuthally dependent and the region of noise generation moves dramatically upstream. It appears that the tabs are directly responsible for an increase in noise over a range of Strouhal numbers between 0.8 and 2.5 through generated streamwise vortices and they are indirectly responsible for the modification of the noise generating mechanisms at Strouhal numbers below 0.6 through the induced spanwise vortex roll-ups.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic inverse methods, based on the output of an array of microphones, can be readily applied to the characterisation of acoustic sources that can be adequately modelled as a number of discrete monopoles. However, there are many situations, particularly in the fields of vibroacoustics and aeroacoustics, where the sources are distributed continuously in space over a finite area (or volume). This paper is concerned with the practical problem of applying inverse methods to such distributed source regions via the process of spatial sampling. The problem is first tackled using computer simulations of the errors associated with the application of spatial sampling to a wide range of source distributions. It is found that the spatial sampling criterion for minimising the errors in the radiated far-field reconstructed from the discretised source distributions is strongly dependent on acoustic wavelength but is only weakly dependent on the details of the source field itself. The results of the computer simulations are verified experimentally through the application of the inverse method to the sound field radiated by a ducted fan. The un-baffled fan source with the associated flow field is modelled as a set of equivalent monopole sources positioned on the baffled duct exit along with a matrix of complimentary non-flow Green functions. Successful application of the spatial sampling criterion involves careful frequency-dependent selection of source spacing, and results in the accurate reconstruction of the radiated sound field. Discussions of the conditioning of the Green function matrix which is inverted are included and it is shown that the spatial sampling criterion may be relaxed if conditioning techniques, such as regularisation, are applied to this matrix prior to inversion.},

The results are very useful, though initially misleading and difficult to comprehend. Recent publications have helped explain beamforming results of rotating coherent noise sources, typical tonal noise sources for counter-rotating open rotors. Building on the former results, the present beamforming investigation provides a novel approach for identifying broadband noise sources of counter-rotating open rotors. The method pinpoints dominant broadband noise sources to given areas of the rotor surface, and also helps separate out a noise source associated with shaft orders which result from blade nonuniformities, such as measurement instrumentation mounted on the rotor surface, which could otherwise be mistakenly associated with the tonal or broadband noise sources.},

The planar microphone array was positioned broadside and parallel to the axis of the open rotor, roughly 2.3 rotor diameters away. The results provide insight as to why the apparent noise sources of the blade passing frequency tones and interaction tones appear at their nominal Mach radii instead of at the actual noise sources, even if those locations are not on the blades. Contour maps corresponding to the sound fields produced by the radiating sound waves, taken from the simulations, are used to illustrate how the interaction patterns of circumferential spinning modes of rotating coherent noise sources interact with the phased array, often giving misleading results, as the apparent sources do not always show where the actual noise sources are located. This suggests that a more sophisticated source model would be required to accurately locate the sources of each tone. The results of this study also have implications with regard to the shielding of open rotor sources by airframe empennages.},

The measurements were conducted in the NASA Langley Quiet Flow Facility using a 41-microphone directional array system positioned at a range of polar and azimuthal observer angles with respect to the model. DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources) array processing as well as straightforward individual microphone processing were employed to compile unique flyover and sideline directivity databases for a range of freestream Mach numbers (0.11 – 0.17) covering typical approach conditions. Comprehensive corrections were applied to the test data to account for shear layer ray path and amplitude variations. This allowed proper beamforming at different measurement orientations, as well as directivity presentation in free-field emission coordinates. Four different configurations of the landing gear were tested: a baseline configuration with and without an attached side door, and a noise reduction concept “toboggan” truck fairing with and without side door. Spectral analyses demonstrated that individual microphones could establish model spectra. This finding permitted the determination of unique, spatially-detailed directivity contours of spectral band levels over a hemispherical surface. Spectral scaling for the baseline model confirmed that the acoustic intensity scaled with the expected sixth-power of the Mach number. A comparison of spectra and directivity between the baseline gear and the gear with
an attached toboggan indicated that the toboggan fairing may be of some value in reducing gear noise over particular frequency ranges. Finally, spectrum results were scaled quantitatively to data obtained from flyover tests of a full-scale 777 aircraft. The comparison showed good agreement in frequency and level, suggesting the general applicability of the model-scale noise results.},

Custom microphone shading algorithms have been developed to provide a frequency- and position-invariant sensing area from 10-40 kHz with an overall targeted frequency range for the array of 5-60 kHz.

  Abstract                 = {Microphone directional array technology continues to be a critical part of the overall instrumentation suite for experimental aeroacoustics. Unfortunately, high sensor cost remains one of the limiting factors in the construction of very high-density arrays (i.e., arrays containing several hundred channels or more) which could be used to implement advanced beamforming algorithms. In an effort to reduce the implementation cost of such arrays, the authors have undertaken a systematic performance analysis of a prototype 35-microphone array populated with commercial electret condenser microphones. An ensemble of microphones coupling commercially available electret cartridges with passive signal conditioning circuitry was fabricated for use with the Langley Large Aperture Directional Array (LADA). A performance analysis consisting of three phases was then performed: (1) characterize the acoustic response of the microphones via laboratory testing and calibration, (2) evaluate the beamforming capability of the electret-based LADA using a series of independently controlled point sources in an anechoic environment, and (3) demonstrate the utility of an electret-based directional array in a real-world application, in this case a cold flow jet operating at high subsonic velocities. The results of the investigation revealed a microphone frequency response suitable for directional array use over a range of 250 Hz - 40 kHz, a successful beamforming evaluation using the electret-populated LADA to measure simple point sources at frequencies up to 20 kHz, and a successful demonstration using the array to measure noise generated by the cold flow jet. This paper presents an overview of the tests conducted along with sample data obtained from those tests.},

  Abstract                 = {Current generation microphone directional array instrumentation is capable of extracting accurate noise source location and directivity data on a variety of aircraft components, resulting in significant gains in test productivity. However, with this gain in productivity has come the desire to install larger and more complex arrays in a variety of ground test facilities, creating new challenges for the designers of array systems. To overcome these challenges, a research study was initiated to identify and develop hardware and fabrication technologies which could be used to construct an array system exhibiting acceptable measurement performance but at much lower cost and with much simpler installation requirements. This paper describes an effort to fabricate a 128-sensor array using commercially available Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) microphones. The MEMS array was used to acquire noise data for an isolated 26%-scale high-fidelity Boeing 777 landing gear in the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Stability Tunnel across a range of Mach numbers. The overall performance of the array was excellent, and major noise sources were successfully identified from the measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Trailing edge (TE) noise measurements for a NACA 63-215 airfoil model are presented, providing benchmark experimental data for a cambered airfoil. The effects of flow Mach number and angle of attack of the airfoil model with different TE bluntnesses are shown. Far-field noise spectra and directivity are obtained using a directional microphone array. Standard and diagonal removal beamforming techniques are evaluated employing tailored weighting functions for quantitatively accounting for the distributed line character of TE noise. Diagonal removal processing is
used for the primary database as it successfully removes noise contaminates. Some TE noise predictions are reported to help interpret the data, with respect to flow speed, angle of attack, and TE bluntness on spectral shape and peak levels. Important findings include the validation of a TE noise directivity function for different airfoil angles of attack and the demonstration of the importance of the directivity function’s convective amplification terms.},

This TE noise measurement approach is compared to one that is based on the cross spectral analysis of output signals from a pair of microphones (COP method). Advantages and limitations of both methods are examined. It is shown that the microphone array can accurately measures TE noise and captures its two-dimensional characteristic over a large frequency range for any TE configuration as long as noise contamination from extraneous sources is within bounds. The COP method is shown to also accurately measure TE noise but over a more limited frequency range that narrows for increased TE thickness. Finally, the applicability and generality of an airfoil self-noise prediction method was evaluated via comparison to the experimental data obtained using the COP and array measurement methods. The predicted and experimental results are shown to agree over large frequency ranges.},

However, the resolution at frequencies below 700 Hz was not sufficient to provide useful noise source identification and quantification. The present paper describes an extended 135-element array with 29 metre diameter, designed for frequencies down to 300 Hz, while still supporting quick deployment on a runway, and it analyzes the results from a series of measurements taken in November 2011 at Taiki Aerospace Research Field, Taiki, Hokkaido, Japan. As in the previous paper, the aircraft under test was a business jet type MU300 from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. For comparison with engine sound power estimates from fly-over measurements, a set of array measurements was performed on the
right engine with the aircraft fixed on the ground. Sound power spectra show good agreement between fly-over and ground-based measurements with comparable engine load conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of the present beamforming systems in commercial and academic applications are performing their calculations solely in the frequency domain. While the early historical beamformers actually have been implemented in the time domain by inclusion of simple analog hardware delay lines, this principle was not applied anymore due to the availability of digital signal processors which allowed the calculation of fast Fourier transforms already within the data acquisition hardware frontends. Nowadays, modern computers offer the feasibility to process huge amounts of multichannel data in the frequency domain as well as in the time domain, so computational effort is not the only concern anymore. The paper compares the benefits and the disadvantages of both domains, focusing on the time domain because the latter is neglected or at least heavily underrepresented throughout the classical array signal processing textbooks and most of the current papers dealing with the beamforming method. Therefore, it is not the purpose of this paper to present a new theory or any advanced algorithms, but rather to give a general overview which is motivated from an application-oriented and practical standpoint of view. It is pointed out that a high signal bandwidth and a sampling rate much higher than twice the Nyquist frequency necessary for the channel data are especially important when working in the time domain. Application examples from technical and nontechnical fields will be given.},

  Abstract                 = {An aeroacoustic study of a 26%-scale landing gear model was conducted in the NASA Ames 7- by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel using a phased microphone array. The incorporation of complex parts via stereo lithography produced a model that can mimic full-scale details down to 3 mm. These details include the contours, brake cylinders, bolt holes, and wheel hubs that appear on the real landing gear. Major noise sources were identified and ranked. From the sideline view, the noise levels of the cable harness and torque link were each at least 8 dB above that of a clean configuration. Sources from the more ambiguous fly-over view, such as the front axle, center axle and rear axle regions, were 11 dB above the clean configuration for frequencies below 2000 Hz full-scale. This increment in noise likely included other sources situated behind the truck. Referenced to the clean configuration, the braces and links contributed as much as 8 dB. Tests with a fully sealed fairing on the landing gear suggest, through careful design of major components, a noise reduction of up to 15 dB can be achieved although 2 to 6 dB of noise reduction is probably a more realistic goal.},

Three beamfoming algorithms are considered. The results of the phased array calculations show that the tonal noise is the dominant source for NACA0012 airfoil operating at low angles of attack and a moderate Reynolds number.

The technique involves shading the linear array using a set of weights, which are calculated according to the locations onto which the nulls need to be steered (in this case onto the second propeller). The technique is based on an established microwave antenna theory, and uses a plane-wave, or far field formulation in order to represent the response of the array by an nth-order polynomial, where n is the number of array elements. The roots of this polynomial correspond to the minima of the array response, and so by an appropriate choice of roots, a polynomial can be generated, the coefficients of which are the weights needed to achieve the prespecified set of null positions. It is shown that, for the technique to work with actual data, the cross-spectral matrix must be conditioned before array shading is implemented. This ensures that the shading function is not distorted by the intrinsic element weighting which can occur as a result of the directional nature of aeroacoustic systems. A difference of 6 dB between measurements before and after null steering shows the technique to have been effective in eliminating the contribution from one of the propellers, thus providing a quantitative measure of the acoustic energy from the other.},

This is then applied to array measurements for an aeroacoustic dipole produced by a cylinder in a cross flow. The resulting source map and the beamformed spectrum are shown to give a true representation of the source energy and frequency content. A secondary effect of this correction is that the array becomes insensitive to other source types so that in addition to acting as a spatial filter, the array can perform as a source filter. This work also demonstrates how an array measurement can be misinterpreted if applied without consideration of the source mechanism.},

The jet was excited over a large range of Strouhal numbers and several azimuthal modes by eight localized arc filament plasma actuators, equally spaced around the circumference of the nozzle, near the nozzle exit. The flow field and far-field noise were investigated using particle image velocimetry and a three-dimensional array of 12 microphones at 30° polar angle to the downstream jet axis. The microphone array results show that the high amplitude noise radiated to 30° polar angle is originated just downstream of the end of the potential core, in agreement with our previous results and the results in the literature. The streamwise noise source distribution was only sensitive to azimuthal modes around the jet preferred mode. Otherwise, the general trend was that forcing the jet at low Strouhal numbers moves the distribution upstream compared to the baseline jet, and at high Strouhal numbers results in a source distribution similar to the baseline jet. Conditionallyaveraged
PIV data were used to relate the flow dynamics and noise sources. The growth, saturation, and decay of the conditionally-averaged velocity fluctuations along the jet centerline correlate well with the far-field noise and the noise source distribution estimated using the microphone array. For m = 0 mode excitation around the jet column Strouhal number, the conditionally-averaged streamwise velocity fluctuations correlate well with the noise source distribution. While for m = 1, the correlation is best with the conditionally-averaged cross-stream fluctuations.},

The interpretation of measurement results is sometimes complicated because of inherent drawbacks of the system and the method itself, and moreover by bad acoustic conditions. The finite number of sensors and the final size of the arrangement of sensors limits the dynamic range and the spatial resolution. In this study synchronized multiple measurements were used to create a virtual larger array, that is, to improve the spatial resolution especially at lower frequencies. In terms of an extended applicability of the Acoustic Camera method first results are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic array measurements have been carried out in a wind tunnel with a closed test-section on a swept constant-chord half-model. The experiments show that strong background noise present in the test section disturbs the array measurements and causes artefacts in source maps obtained with conventional beamforming (CB). By analyzing the components of the wavenumber spectrum in the array plane using the delay-and-sum beamforming with an infinite focal distance it is shown that this noise consists mainly of upstream propagating spurious waves. They can be reduced either by modifications to the wind tunnel test-section or by the BiCLean algorithm, a more advanced array processing technique. In a second step the robustness of deconvolution algorithms is investigated with respect to the noisy data obtained from the closed test-section measurements. The new deconvolution algorithms E-DAMAS2 proposed by Ehrenfried and Koop and the CLEAN-SC algorithm introduced by Sijtsma are applied to the present experimental data. The results show that the spatial resolution can be increased considerably by applying these algorithms and that side lobes are successful suppressed. The integrated spectra obtained from the deconvolution source-powers agree very well with standard source-power integration results based on CB. The background noise which is present in the CB results is detected also with the deconvolution algorithms. But no instabilities have been observed in the deconvolution process due to this noise.},

  Abstract                 = {Microphone array and particle image velocimetry measurements have been performed to investigate the potential of passive and active flow control methods for flap noise reduction. The extended wing flap of the swept constant chord half-model was equipped with either a blowing facility as an active flow control device or with other flap side-edge modifications such as wing tip fences, microtabs and winglets. The flap side edge noise is reduced with the blowing configuration between 2 kHz and 5 kHz. The maximum noise reduction of 15:9 dB is achieved at 2:9 kHz. Varying the diameter of the blowing orifices shows that the noise reduction is governed by the momentum rather than the flow rate of the blowing. The winglets and the suction side fence are most effective in reducing the flap side-edge noise. The reduced level with these configurations is even lower than with the active blowing. The vortex generators and the pressure side fence turn out to be the least effective flow control devices. PIV-measurements at an isolated unswept flap model show that the main vortex on the suction side exhibits a very inhomogeneous vorticity distribution which can be attributed to the unstable shear layer that separates at the lower corner of the flap side-edge and to the negative vorticity production on the suction surface. With blowing the vorticity of the shear layer is concentrated in several small vortices. The distance between those vortices and the solid surface increases with higher blowing momentum and because of this the negative vorticity production due to recirculation is disappears. These distinct modifications of the side-edge flow field explain the noise reduction shown in the aeroacoustic measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {One dominant airframe noise source is situated at the side edge of the extended wing flap. The objective of the present study is to reduce this noise by blowing air into the flap side-edge vortex to displace or destroy the vortical structure and thus reduce the emission of sound. PIV measurements without blowing yield a rather complicated unsteady vortical structure at the flap side-edge which confirms the assumption of a noise source. This is verified by microphone array measurements. They show that the flap side-edge noise, besides other noise sources, is present over a broad frequency range. The flight parameters such as angle of incidence and slat and flap angles, however, determine which noise source is dominant. PIV measurements with blowing show that the vortical structure can be almost completely dispersed and that the maximum vorticity in the vortex core is reduced. Consequently, a reduction of the flap side–edge noise can be seen in the microphone array measurement. In addition, the sound pressure level in the acoustic far field is reduced by 3 to 4 dB above 1.25 kHz.},

The accuracy of an approximative zero-thickness shear layer model, which is used in practice to predict the phase shift between source and microphones, is investigated numerically. The exact wave propagation through a generic shear layer is calculated by solving the full linearized Euler equations using a finite element method and by means of geometrical acoustics. The results are taken to determine the phase deviations between the simplified model and the exact case. It is demonstrated that the position of the zero-thickness shear layer is important for the accuracy at high frequencies. Additionally measurements are made to analyze the phase fluctuations which are generated by the scattering at turbulent structures in the open-jet shear layer. A procedure is proposed to compensate these phase fluctuations and to improve the array efficiency.},

The present study reviews concepts for omni-directional sound sources and evaluates their capability for microphone array calibration. Two concepts of calibration sources with aerodynamic fairings for the use in wind tunnels have been developed. The radiated sound field of both probes was examined in experiments in an anechoic facility. The presented results comprise the spatial amplitude characteristics of the designed sound sources.

  Abstract                 = {The phased microphone array technique is a well established tool in aeroacoustic testing for the localisation and quantiﬁcation of sound sources. The measurements are often carried out in closed or open wind tunnels using scaled models. In both types of wind tunnels ﬂow effects derogate the accuracy of beamforming results. In the open test-section the sound waves have to pass through the wind tunnel shear layer before reaching the microphone. That results in a spatial coherence loss due to turbulent scattering and refraction and potentially leads to degraded source maps and under-estimated source levels. The present study addresses this matter and proposes a calibration approach for an open wind tunnel using an in-ﬂow calibration source. This source employs a ribbon loudspeaker which can provide sufﬁciently high sound pressure levels in a broad frequency range and its properties are known.

  Abstract                 = {The “delay and sum beamformer” algorithm (“DSB”) is a powerful tool for the localisation and quantiﬁcation of acoustic sources with microphone arrays. For the calculation of beamforming maps the DSB algorithm requires the following input data: time series of all microphones, a grid of focus points which includes the region of interest, paramater of the ﬂow for boundary layer or shear layer corrections and the accurate position of all microphones. The present paper is focused on the last item: the accurate estimation of the microphone positions. Especially for aeroacoustic applications the number of microphones should be large enough in order to obtain good beamforming results. The estimation of the accurate microphone positions can mean a huge time consuming eﬀort. The method which will be presented in this paper is similar to the well known global positioning system: distances to satellites provide information about the position of a receiver. Here, several monopole-like acoustical point sources with known positions and a reference microphone which is installed close to the sound sources are used to compute the position of the microphones of a microphone array in the three-dimensional space. After pointing out the basic concepts and algorithms a practical implementation of the test sources is described. Eight test sources and the reference microphone are integrated in a so-called calibration unit. Afterwards a calibration of a microphone array with known microphone positions is presented to verify the method and to assess the accuracy that can be achieved. Furthermore the problem is addressed how many test sources are necessary to achieve accurate results. Finally, the procedure is used to calibrate an out-of-ﬂow microphone array with a layout of microphones where the positions are only known with some uncertainty. Investigations concerning the frequency dependence of the calibration are presented. Beamforming on a loudspeaker is performed to show in how far more accurately known microphone positions can improve beamforming results, particularly in the higher frequency range.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustically optimized wind tunnels usually have an anechoic chamber around an open test section. For array measurements in this type of tunnels the acoustic array is typically placed outside the flow field - beside or above the test section. The sound emitted from sources in the flow has to propagate through a turbulent shear layer to reach the microphones. During their passage through the shear layer the sound waves interact with turbulent structures. The higher the frequency of the wave, the more significant the effect of the shear layer is. In the present paper these interaction of sound waves with a turbulent shear layer is investigated. It is analyzed which effects can occur when sound waves propagate through a turbulent shear layer and how these effects can influence the results of array measurements. Experiments with a test source in a wind tunnel with open test section are performed. It is shown that turbulent structures in the shear layer lead to systematic phase fluctuations. These phase fluctuations have a certain spectrum and a distinct spatial correlation. Beside these effects the spectral broadening of tones due to the propagation trough the shear layer is investigated.},

The acoustic transfer system between elementary sources and microphone positions, very under-determined, is then reduced to a square system using singular value decomposition. The high frequency limitation of this method is studied, as well as the regularization techniques that have to be used at low frequency. A Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out to compare the efficiency of generalized cross validation and L-curve validation to choose the Tikhonov regularization parameter. A combined validation criterion is finally proposed to take advantage of both approaches.},

In the experiments, a 0.8-cm-diameter burner was used to produce a subsonic, turbulent jet with a Mach number of 0.26. Six fixed, linear arrays holding eight reference microphones apiece were disposed circumferentially around the jet, and a circular array holding sixteen, equally spaced field microphones was traversed along the jet axis to measure the sound field on a 30-cm-diameter cylindrical surface enclosing the jet. The results revealed that the jet could be modeled as a combination of eleven uncorrelated dipole-, quadrupole-, and octupole-like sources, and the contribution of each source type to the total radiated sound power could be identified. Both the total sound field reconstructed in a three-dimensional space and the farfield radiation directivity obtained by using the latter model were successfully validated by comparisons to directly measured results.},

The noise source distribution along the engine centerline was investigated the 39-microphone arc array. The 39-microphone arc array system whose microphones were located between 70 and 160 degrees successfully identify the relative importance between the jet noise and the other internal noise sources, that include inlet, fan and core noises. The relative strength between the fan noise and the core noise was investigated by using the system of 13 microphones between 75 and 105 degrees. The 6 microphones from 70 to 90 degrees are used for the upstream angle noise characteristics. The ratios of the beamforming levels of the baseline configuration to those of the treated core are used to investigate the effectiveness of a core treatment. It is shown that the treated core reduced the internal core noise for the frequencies between 300 and 550 Hz. The phased-array analysis identified the reduced core noise even at high speed condition where the narrowband spectra were almost identical. The beamforming analysis from the 32-microphone spiral array shows the same result.},

Measurements of velocity were also obtained using cross-stream stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV). Among the three nozzle lengths tested, the medium length nozzle was the quietest for all mixers at high frequency on the highest speed flow condition. Large differences in source strength distributions between nozzles and mixers occurred at or near the nozzle exit for this flow condition. The beamforming analyses from the azimuthal array for the 12-lobed mixer on the highest flow condition showed that the core flow and the lobe area were strong noise sources for the long and short nozzles. The 12 noisy spots associated with the lobe locations of the 12-lobed mixer with the long nozzle were very well detected for the frequencies 5 KHz and higher. Meanwhile, maps of the source strength of the axisymmetric splitter show that the outer shear layer was the most important noise source at most flow conditions. In
general, there was a good correlation between the high turbulence regions from the PIV tests and the high noise source regions from the phased-array measurements.},

From the measured source distributions locations of peak strength were tracked and found to be very consistent between adjacent narrowband frequencies. In low speed heated and unheated jets, the peak source locations vary smoothly from the nozzle exit to downstream as the frequency is decreased.

Numerical validation results show that the elastic net regularization technique could improve both the resolution and accuracy compared with DAS (Delay-and-Sum) beamforming and DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources) algorithm, particularly for cases under low signal-to-noise ratios. To demonstrate the advantage of the elastic net regularization, the NACA0012 airfoil self-noise sources are localized based on a direct numerical simulation database.

In this study, the identification and attenuation of the tonal-noise source has been carried out using a one-quarter-scale A340 main-landing-gear model. Aeroacoustic and aerodynamic tests were conducted in a closed-section wind tunnel, using a phased microphone array on the ceiling of the test section, flush-mounted pressure transducers on the model surface, and the particleimage- velocimetry technique. Far-field noise tests were then taken in an open jet aeroacoustic facility, using far-field microphones to verify the wind-tunnel test results.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a beamforming correction for dipole source identification by means of phased microphone array measurements is proposed and validated by numerical simulation. Conventional beamforming algorithms are normally based on the monopole source assumption, and can result in significant misinterpretation when applied directly to array measurements of dipole sources. A previous correction technique aims to realign the phases of microphone signals, and has been proved effective to retrieve dipole locations. However, this technique is only applicable to a single source with a linear microphone array and thus its applications are limited in practice. This work extends the signal correction technique to account for both source location and source power for 2-D microphone arrays. A dipole characteristic term is obtained based on theoretical analysis and used for the correction of both signal phase and amplitude. Numerical simulations are performed for a ideal dipole source and a reference monopole to validate the improved beamforming correction. Simulation results have shown that the proposed correction technique is capable of reconstructing dipole sources in both location and amplitude. It is therefore suggested to carefully consider the source mechanisms of aeroacoustic systems before applying array measurements. },

Experiments were also performed and the results confirmed that roughness noise is not a negligible sound source. In this study, phased arrays were applied to localize the possible dipole sound sources due to roughness elements on a flat plate. The radiated sound from two rough and one smooth plates in an open jet was measured by 48-channel phased arrays at three locations. The rough regions were manufactured by a square distribution of rigid, hemispherical bosses on a rigid plate. The beamforming source maps obtained at different locations have displayed some features of dipole sources, and the rough plates have shown higher source strengths than the smooth plate.

  Abstract                 = {Beamforming is presented as a general tool for the analysis of a fluctuating pressure field in the presence of high speed turbulent flow. These fluctuations can be either hydrodynamic, which convect with the mean flow turbulence, or acoustic fluctuations that propagate at the local speed of sound. The present study focuses on the pressure fluctuations created by models installed in a transonic wind tunnel. Subspace Beamforming is used to isolate the structural features of the turbulent and/or the acoustic field using data collected on a multi-element microphone array. Results for two test cases are presented following development of the analytical procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {In the scientific and industrial community a growing interest is nowadays devoted to sound source localization techniques. Among all the existing methods, the use of the beamforming algorithm in sound source localization problems is increasing, thanks to its many advantages if compared to the other available methods (Nearfield Acoustic Holography and Helmholtz Equation Least Square Method). The beamforming limits are well known and deeply investigated in literature and the study of possible solutions to overcome these limitations is a key point. The present paper deals with the spatial aliasing problem and proposes an innovative approach to improve the method performances. The spatial aliasing phenomenon causes the appearance of “ghost sources” in the reconstructed images. An innovative solution based on the use of moving microphone arrays is here proposed. The array motion, multiplying the measurement points, allows to reduce the aliasing errors. This paper presents the theoretical background of the innovative method and the results obtained with numerical simulations, in comparison with the traditional “Delay & Sum” method. The influence of some parameters, such as the array speed, and the geometry are investigated and a first experimental validation is given.},

Additionally, measurements are considered that are obtained in the framework of an SNCF acoustic test campaign performed on a TGV-Duplex at speeds up to 350 km/h. These comprise source localisation using two-dimensional acoustic array measurements and assessment of the wayside noise increase as a function of the speed. The conclusions drawn in the DEUFRAKO K project are compared with the new set of data. A detailed analysis of the results is also provided, supported by complementary measurements (wheel and rail measurements) and simulations (TWINS calculations).},

In this paper we study this dependence and we show that array localization ability is uniquely determined by a single scalar function — the array beampattern. By analyzing absolute lower bounds on the mean-square-error (mse) of the source location estimates in different scenarios we exploit the relation between features of the array beampattern and the best achievable array localization performance. The beampattern is characterized by its sidelobes level and smoothness, its beamwidth and its mainlobe curvature. We study the effect of these features on source localization properties such as sensitivity to the presence of other sources, resolution ability, sensitivity to ambiguous estimates, etc.},

  Abstract                 = {The „Acoustic Camera“ is a measurement tool which joined the field of acoustics a few years ago also in industrial applications. Simple mapping of a virtual plane at a fixed distance is sufficient if the interesting object has a planar surface and we can arrange array and surface orthogonally. In contrast, the surface of many real objects shows complex three dimensional structures. In these cases, the approximation of three dimensional structures onto a plane implements errors in calculating the focus of the beamformer. A correct calculation is possible if we replace the mapping of a virtual plane at a fixed distance by different measurement distances to individual points at a 3D-model surface. The paper discusses advantages and disadvantages of 2D- and 3D-mapping. In interior spaces the mapping of a plane is not practicable. A car interior for example is composed by many different flat and round subareas. In addition to mapping of three dimensional surfaces we need an omni-directional, non-planar array for complete 3Dmapping. A second problem is how to determine the position and direction of an array in the interior room. The paper discusses the geometry and acoustic properties of microphone arrays which are applicable for a complete 3D-mapping of interior rooms and offers a practicable way of determining the array position and direction related to the measurement object.},

  Abstract                 = {The localization of stationary and transient sound sources on moving or static objects by multichannel arrays is State of the art for several years. In many industrial sectors (e.g. automotive industry, aircraft industry...) this method is indispensable for the noise reduction, noise analysis and error detection. Analysing moving sound sources increased requirements of hardware and software components. With the aid of light barriers or GPS in combination with inertial navigation systems (INS), it is possible to determine the mostly unknown average speed, or to estimate the speed as a function of time. Also entry and exit times of the moving objects can be determined. For smaller measurement campaigns, this method is not efficient.
For fast moving, long objects (e.g. rail vehicle, truck) often it is not possible to take a photo of the entire object with the built-in optical camera during the measurement. Hence, usually a draft is overlaid with the acoustical image manually, which, however, often does not match the actual object completely and therefore the exact localization of the acoustic sources proves difficult. Furthermore, a frequency shift due to the Doppler effect is present in the sound signals affecting the runtime and phase information which are essential to Beamforming. This leads to significant spatial and spectral blurring of sound sources in the acoustical image. Efficient methods are presented in this paper which allow the solution of solving the complex tasks of generating optical photos of the entire object, overlaying the images automatically and determining the velocity profile as well as enter and exit times using a microphone array with an integrated camera. Another section deals with the algorithm for the determination of the source position under consideration of the Doppler effect.},

The microphone antenna was invented by Billingsley (1974) and has since seen dramatic improvements due to the availability of better data acquisition and computing hardware. Recent mathematical and software developments invert the beamforming process and allow a quantitative determination of the sources. Beamforming is indispensable for the localization of sound sources on moving objects, on flying aircraft, on high-speed trains, on motor cars in motion, on open rotors like helicopter and wind turbine rotors. In these applications, the ability to follow the motion of the sources is important. The second important applications are source localization tests in the test sections of open and closed wind tunnels. The background noise suppression capability of the beamforming method is required here. The various applications are discussed with a long list of references.},

identification of the noise sources when the vehicle is in motion. Wheel-rail noise and aerodynamic noise of railways, airframe noise and installed engine noise of aircraft, tyre-road noise of automobiles are typical examples. The method has improved in the past years with the appearance of data acquisition systems capable of sampling a large number of signals and the use of relatively cheap electret microphones. In addition, the data reduction computing times have decreased substantially with modern fast personal computers. The requirements for source localisation on aircraft are especially high. The large flyover altitudes require large array dimensions and large number of microphones. The system that has been developed by DLR for this application will be presented. The spatial resolution and the requirements for the data acquisition are derived. The limits and possibilities for obtaining quantitative results are also demonstrated. Various examples for the distribution of noise sources on aircraft and motor vehicles will be shown and discussed.},

The influences of various parameters were studied by flying with three different airspeeds (220, 250, 275 m/s) in unaccelerated flight and three different engine power settings (flight idle; normal; max dry) with identical airspeeds (250 m/s) over the measuring position. The influence of external stores on airframe noise was studied by flying with stores first and repeating all tests with an operationally clean aircraft. Two surprising results were found, (i) airframe noise is louder with the aircraft in the operationally clean configuration, and (ii) a strong noise source exists close to the nozzle exit plane that dominates the noise radiation toward the side and into the forward arc.},

A surprising finding is a noise source near the wing tips of some aircraft which is tentatively called wake-vortex wing interaction noise. It is shown to be the by far strongest noise source (6 dB(A) louder than the engines) on a regional jet aircraft.

  Abstract                 = {The directivities of all broadband sound sources of an aeroengine can be determined from measurements with a line array of microphones. A new data analysis method SODIX (SOurce DIrectivity modelling in cross-spectral matriX) was developed for this purpose and applied to the experimental data obtained with a high-bypass ratio turbofan engine in an open air test bed. The method is based on modelling the matrix of the cross-spectra of the microphone signals with a set of contributions from point sources with unknown directivities assumed in positions along the engine axis. The source positions are deﬁned with a separation of typically 0.4 wave lengths. The analysis has to be performed in narrow frequency bands. The inﬂuences of tones are eliminated in the cross-spectral matrix of the microphone signals by interpolation in the frequency domain. The unknown directivities of the point sources are determined with the side conditions that the values must be non-negative and that the directivities and source distributions are smooth. The results of this non-linear optimisation problem conﬁrm that the various sources of an aeroengine have highly non-uniform directivities. The far ﬁeld can be predicted from the source distributions for positions over a large range of emission angles. The predictions on a 45.72 m radius around the engine agree within about 1 dB with experimental data. These far-ﬁeld directivities can be separated into the contributions from inlet, casing, the two nozzles, and the jet.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, low frequency noise generated in the turbofan engine core may make a significant contribution to the overall noise signature in the aft direction at the low power settings which are used on an airport flight approach trajectory. The presence of low frequency indirect combustion noise may be a problem for future aircraft. This paper discusses the development of identification techniques. Magnitude squared coherence function and cross-spectral density phase angle measurement made in a turbofan engine at the combustor and turbine exit are used to show the presence of indirect combustion noise over the frequency range of 0-400 Hz. The coherence is above 0.4 from 0-100 Hz. In addition, a four parameter low frequency turbine transfer function is discussed. It provides a means to relate measurements of the pressure cross-spectral density and the autospectral density at the turbine exit to measurements of the pressure autospectral density in the combustor for the particular turbofan engine studied over a range of operating conditions. An estimate of the contribution of the combustion noise to the total noise at the turbine exit would be useful. The linear system transfer function approach has limited success in the indirect combustion noise source region from 0-50 Hz. However, the coherence and time delay measurements indicate that the indirect combustion noise dominates in this frequency range so this has little consequence as far as source identification. It is in better agreement in the 50-100 Hz linear system region. The results show indirect combustion noise is important in the 0-100 Hz region and at higher frequencies this contribution falls to levels far below that of the measured turbine exit autospectral density. Current combustion noise prediction capability does not include indirect combustion noise and thus applies over a very narrow design space. The underlying physics discussed herein is not included. Consequently, new turbofan engine core configurations might be outside the current combustion noise prediction capability.},

  Abstract                 = {The main aim of this paper is first to present the Bayesian inference approach for sources separation where we want to infer on the mixing matrix, the sources and all the hyper-parameters associated to probabilistic modeling (likelihood and priors). For this purpose, the sources separation problem is considered in four steps: i) Estimation of the sources when the mixing matrix is known; ii) Estimation of the mixing matrix when the sources are known; iii) Joint estimation of sources and the mixing matrix; and finally, iv) Joint estimation of sources and the mixing matrix, hidden variables and hyper-parameters. In all cases, one of the main steps is modeling of sources and the mixing matrix prior laws. We propose to use sparsity enforcing probability laws (such as Generalized Gaussian, Student-t and mixture models) both for the sources and the mixing matrix. For algorithmic and computational aspects, we consider either Joint MAP, MCMC Gibbs sampling or Variational Bayesian Approximation tools. For each class of methods we discuss about their relative costs and performances},

A single microphone provides an acoustic time history or a pressure spectrum from the acoustic signal received at one spatial location. A pair of microphones adds the ability to measure coherence and acoustic intensity. With the improved performance to cost ratio of electronic equipment and computers, it is now practical for researchers to make acoustic measurements with phased arrays containing many microphones. Measurements made with phased arrays offer the significant benefits of locating sources and making accurate acoustic measurements in adverse environments that contain high background noise levels and/or reflections. This paper describes the basics of array processing, special considerations for aeroacoustic testing in wind tunnels, the current methods used in Ames' 40- by 80- Foot Wind Tunnel and developments needed to expand the range and usefulness of arrays in aeroacoustic testing.},

  Abstract                 = {Performance of the basic delay and sum beamforming is influenced by the reflections of sound from surfaces in the environment. In closed spaces this effect is even more significant, where signals from the high number of close secondary mirror image sources interfere with the primary signal. However, one can also make use of the presence of these image sources. If the geometry of the surrounding surfaces is known, one can also focus on the closest secondary image sources, create secondary sound maps (images) and combine them with the primary ones. The advantage of focusing on the secondary sources is that they are seen under independent direction characteristics, which allows the elimination of real interferences, obstructing objects. In this paper we present the results of our investigations of employing room acoustical considerations to increase efficiency and performance of a random-placed microphone array used in a closed enclosure. A simple case of a shoebox shaped room is used for the simulations. The effect, advantages and limits of using sound maps created by second and higher order image sources is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Growing demands on the acoustic comfort of a vehicle and the increase of the importance of lightweight design represent a new challenge in acoustic development tools of an automobile manufacturer. Traditional acoustic measurement techniques offer the opportunity to make statements about structure-borne noise and airborne sound radiation by a vehicle component using accelerometers and microphones. Structure-borne noise and airborne sound sensors thus provide direct information on the accelerations and the sound pressure in the near field. However, single channel methods reach their limits there, where it is important to determine the complex radiation patterns and their superposition into directional radiation. But especially in the interior of the vehicle the direction information of the airborne noise radiation to the occupants is of superior importance. In airborne sound this possibility is given by the microphone array technology (Beamforming). Beyond usual body and airborne sound information, beamforming can thus provide important additional information on the influence of acoustic phenomena on the sound field and the places of occurrence in the vehicle interior. To make the extension to the beamforming suitable and efficient, the evaluation of the results is carried out in multiple stages. The represented work based on a practical example illustrates the methodology of such an advanced, multi-stage approach in the acoustic development of a car manufacturer and will show the potential to improve the sound source localization in the vehicle interior.},

  Abstract                 = {Ancient theaters are used for live performances for a variety of venues, and there is a demand for detail information relating to sound field within these remarkable historical architectural buildings. The objectives methods used to examine these types of spaces for their room acoustic characteristics are on site measurement at their current status and structural integrity, computer simulation and or scale models incorporating the past archeological records for their architectural details that relate to material and surface characteristics. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the ability to visualize sound fields of real and simulated spaces. Research objectives are to capture a space sound signature that significantly represents the characteristics of all architectural elements with their contributions to the room acoustics toward their historical preservation, and to visualize the audible impact of these elements, and represent these acoustic conditions within a virtual environment for the general public to experience. This paper describes a new approach in measuring the contribution of various frequency ranges for evaluation of the existing condition of the Rome Coliseum. Data were measured using Acoustic Camera spherical array, 120 channel data recorders, and utilizing various acoustic software for data reduction, computer modelling, simulation and analysis. The measured and simulated results based on these parametric studies are compared against selected well-known studies of Greek and Roman theatres. As part of the new historical preservation effort, and given the historical records on the use of materials with their unique surface characteristic, the frequency domain and spectral analysis are used as input to the computer modelling, simulation and analysis of the space. Newly developed room acoustic indicators provide a new approach in estimating the impact of the direct and reflected sound contribution to the sound level available within the current space. The results show a new research approach in room acoustics evaluation utilizing current standards and techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {The noise generated by the crowds and organized fans during sporting events has created a challenge for the sport facility management. The new demand for full compliance to National Football League rules on crowd noise, and cities' regulations on noise ordinance require new methods or approaches in measuring such environmental conditions. Given their dynamic range and possible classification, noise levels generated by large crowds has impacted the outcome of games, and recent analysis of the available data shows an increase in noise related penalties. This situation has provided more excitement for the spectators and greater participation in the events, however sound intensity of 95 to 110dBA is now the typically reported range of recorded noise levels within various sport arenas. This paper describes a new approach in measuring crowd noise, and estimating the contribution of various frequency ranges for evaluation of the existing, and in this case, the proposed University of Michigan newly designed addition of sky boxes to the football stadium. Data was measured using Acoustic Camera spherical array, 120 channel data recorder, and utilizing various acoustic software for data reduction, computer modeling, simulation and analysis. The measured and simulated results based on these parametric studies are compared against selected well known stadiums for their crowd noise conditions. The frequency domain and spectral analysis are used as input to the computer modeling, simulation and analysis of the space. Using newly developed room acoustic indicators provide a new approach in estimating the impact of the reflected sound contribution to the crowd noise; given the sky boxes as part of the new addition with their unique facade and window geometry.},

  Abstract                 = {Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) describes how a given sound wave input is filtered by the diffraction and reflection properties of the body, before the sound reaches the
eardrum. HRTF measurements of a population of US - American troops in the 1960s provided the data and knowledge of the measurement technology for various acoustic application including artificial head. The use of Acoustic camera allows to perform very complex functions in room acoustic evaluation in real timeand examine the room acoustic characteristics under different sound sources and room acoustic conditions. The real time data provides the designers and audio engineer to fine tune or calibrate their sound system for a given standard associated to architectural design. The data obtain through this system also provides the fundamentals to validate the latest software in acoustic design and or audio engineering. The process establishes new room acoustic indexes for pre and post design evaluations. This paper describes the process in obtaining the HRTF and its conversion to Spatial Frequency Response Surfaces through the format used by MATLAB data files of compensated Head-Related Impulse Response (HRIR) measurements. The measurements were made using Acoustic Camera with its' various settings and capabilities under real room acoustic conditions. Hearing with both ears is defined as binaural hearing. It provides the ability in hearing the sound naturally and accurately. The sound that is received from both ears allows to locate the direction and true spatial perception of sounds. The geometrical parameters of the human body have a major impact on binaural hearing. The application and the analysis of the latest room acoustic measurements by Acoustic Camera allows to examine this concept and new development in the creation of a possible new room acoustic index. This approach will include an improved representation of the current indexes used in architectural design. and contributes to the upgrading of the current standards for room acoustics.},

It is assumed that a number of acoustic sources are located at known spatial positions and that the acoustic pressure is measured at a number of spatial positions in the radiated field. The transfer functions relating the strengths of the acoustic sources to the radiated pressures are also assumed known. In principle, the strengths of the acoustic sources can be deduced from the measured acoustic pressures by inversion of this matrix of transfer functions. The accuracy of source strength reconstruction (in the presence of noise which contaminates the measured pressures) is crucially dependent on the conditioning of the matrix to be inverted. This paper examines the conditioning of this inverse problem, particularly with regard to the geometry and number of sources and measurement positions and the non-dimensional frequency. A preliminary investigation is also presented of methods such as Tikhonov regularization and singular value discarding which can improve the accuracy of source strength reconstruction in poorly conditioned cases. Results are also presented which enable the solution of the inverse problem when the time histories of the acoustic sources are time-stationary random processes and the spectra and cross-spectra are measured at a number of positions in the radiated field. The paper illustrates the possibilities and limitations of the use of inverse methods in the deduction of acoustic source strength from radiated field measurements.}

  Abstract                 = {Earlier studies have shown that hovercraft noise is dominated by 2 tonal noises – the engine firing frequency and the blade passing frequency. 3D narrowband beamforming analysis of the latter on a particular test craft shows there are at least 2 major sources apparent within each bladepass period. But standard time domain beamforming using the whole bladepass Fourier waveform gives a noisepicture which is an average of the two sources. By gating in timeslot slices of the total bladepass Fourier waveform and time domain beamforming only on that slice it's possible to see clearly how each source develops and decays during the bladepass period. By splitting the total bandpass waveform into 32 such time slices a short ‘movie’ is produced. A downside of this partial waveform technique is that the sound sources appear to move over time towards the centre of the microphone array, due largely to the way the beamformer works. However the volume peaks within this movie do indicate accurately the position of the sources of noise and their phase relationship with the position of the fan blades. In the case of our test craft this partial waveform technique showed 2 noise sources within the lift air distribution ducting behind the fan, where the air is poorly ducted and thus air turbulence is likely to occur. One particular source correlated well with a regular dirty patch deposited in the same position on a similar craft, which was cured by improving the ducting.},

NoiseCam, a homebrew 2D beamforming system, has been used on over 130 amateur craft worldwide to identify the loudest noise sources, resulting in several craft being reduced by up to 10 dBA. It localises and quantifies individual tonal sources such as engine exhausts, air intakes and fan turbulence in the range 40 Hz to 800 Hz, typically within about 100 mm and about 5 Hz. A number of improvements have been made to the system. It now incorporates a ring of far-field dba meters to provide direct traceability from regulatory dba measurements, through frequency analysis and then beamforming to locate the key sources. The problem of large spot size and positional displacement of low frequency sources has been addressed by a technique for adding spikes to the beamformer waveforms. A 3D microphone array with 24 mics is being developed to reduce astigmatism and better identify fan turbulence sources. Turbulent areas identified by the system have been confirmed by probing with pressure sensors. An air horn audio marker beacon now provides better alignment between the noisepics and conventional pictures.},

The system uses a highly portable 2 metre radius semicircular array of 16 microphones with comb filter software to focus on tonal noise, a delay and multiply algorithm to improve ‘noise picture’ definition and a simple inverse technique to estimate the db elimination value of individual frequencies. It pinpoints sources in the range 30hz to 800hz, typically within about 100mm and about 5hz, even though several similarly loud sources are present within the space of about a 1.5 metre cube. The common sources are engine air intakes, exhaust silencers, and various fan obstructions such as pulleys, radiators, stators, engine covers etc causing airflow turbulence and thus noise.

  Abstract                 = {This thesis deals with the detection of aeroacoustic sound sources on aircraft and wind turbines using phased microphone arrays. First, the reliability of the array technique is assessed using airframe noise measurements in open and closed wind tunnels. It is demonstrated that quantitative acoustic measurements are possible in both wind tunnels. Then, the array technique is applied to characterize the noise sources on two modern large wind turbines. It is shown that practically all noise emitted to the ground is produced by the outer part of the blades during their downward movement. This asymmetric source pattern, which causes the typical swishing noise during the passage of the blades, can be explained by trailing edge noise directivity and convective amplification. Next, a semi-empirical prediction method is developed for the noise from large wind turbines. The prediction code is successfully validated against the experimental results, not only with regard to sound levels, spectra, and directivity, but also with regard to the noise source distribution in the rotor plane and the temporal variation in sound level (swish). The validated prediction method is then applied to calculate wind turbine noise footprints, which show that large swish amplitudes can occur even at large distance. The influence of airfoil shape on blade noise is investigated through acoustic wind tunnel tests on a series of wind turbine airfoils. Measurements are carried out at various wind speeds and angles of attack, with and without upstream turbulence and boundary layer tripping. The speed dependence, directivity, and tonal behaviour are determined for both trailing edge noise and inflow turbulence noise. Finally, two noise reduction concepts are tested on a large wind turbine: acoustically optimized airfoils and trailing edge serrations. Both blade modifications yield a significant trailing edge noise reduction at low frequencies, but also cause increased tip noise at high frequencies. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that using trailing edge serrations wind turbine noise can be halved without adverse effects on the aerodynamic performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic array measurements were performed on a three-bladed GAMESA G58 wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 58 m and a tower height of 53.5 m. The goal was to characterize the noise sources on this turbine, and to verify whether aerodynamic noise from the blades is dominant. In order to assess the effect of blade roughness, one blade was cleaned, one blade was tripped, and one blade was left untreated. The acoustic array consisted of 152 microphones mounted on a horizontal wooden platform (15 by 18 m2), which was positioned about 58 m upwind from the rotor. In parallel to the acoustic measurements, a number of turbine parameters were monitored, such as wind speed, power, turbine orientation, RPM, and blade pitch angle. In total more than 100 measurements were taken at wind speeds between 6 and 10 m/s. Two array processing methods were used to characterise the noise from the turbine. First, the noise sources in the rotor plane were localised using conventional beamforming. These results clearly show that, besides a minor source at the rotor hub, practically all noise (radiated to the ground) is produced during the downward movement of the blades. The noise is produced by the outer part of the blades (but not by the very tip), and blade noise levels scale with the 5th power of the local flow speed. The second processing method employed rotating scan planes to localise the noise sources on the individual blades. It turns out that the tripped blade is significantly noisier than the clean and untreated blades, which is a strong indication of trailing edge noise (rather than inflow turbulence noise). The similar noise levels for the clean and untreated blades suggest that the untreated blade was aerodynamically clean.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic array measurements were carried out on a 1:10.6 scaled Airbus A340 model. Tests were done in both the open jet and a closed test section of the DNW-LLF wind tunnel. The purpose of these measurements was to investigate several noise reduction concepts for high-lift devices (slats and flaps) in landing configuration. The possibilities and limitations of arrays for the determination of quantitative results are discussed. Besides the identification of dominant noise source regions with conventional beamforming, local source spectra were determined using a power integration method. For the open jet results, the integration method was applied with and without the 'diagonal removal' (DR) technique, in which the main diagonal of the cross-power matrix is discarded. It is shown that application of DR results in meaningful local spectra, whereas without DR the results are obscured by the influence of the main diagonal. On the other hand, by comparing integrated spectra with absolute sound levels on farfield microphones, it is shown that the application of DR, in combination with coherence loss, results in significantly reduced absolute levels. However, while the absolute sound levels can be too low, level differences between configurations can be accurately determined under certain conditions. From the closed test section array results, dominant source regions are identified as a function of frequency and angle-ofattack. These results are quantified by application of the integration method to several source areas on the wing. The local and overall effect of noise reduction devices is assessed. The effect of coherence loss on the absolute levels is investigated by varying the effective array size.},

  Abstract                 = {The phased array technique is a valuable tool in acoustic testing for its capability to distinguish between different source locations. However, the interpretation of phased array measurements is still difficult due to the simultaneous occurrence of several effects: the size and level of a spot in a conventional acoustic 'source plot' may be affected by a combination of (1) the limited resolution of the array (2) coherence loss during propagation to the array (3) the spatial extent of the source region. This ambiguity complicates the determination of absolute source levels from phased array measurements. The current paper addresses this problem for a noise source that is extended mainly in one direction, i.e. trailing-edge noise. Simulations are done for a line source, and the influence of array resolution and source coherence length on the array output is investigated. Furthermore, an array processing technique is presented which determines the coherence level between different sources in the scan plane. As a first application, the technique is used to identify
mirror sources in a closed wind tunnel. The new method is then applied to trailing-edge noise measurements in NLR's Small Anechoic Wind Tunnel, in order to estimate the spanwise coherence length. In conjunction with the simulations this enables an improved determination of absolute trailing-edge noise from phased array measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {A convenient method for airframe noise measurements in an open jet acoustic wind tunnel is the combination of an out-of-flow phased array with a semi-open test section consisting of two sideplates between which a model can be mounted. In this paper the effects of these side-plates on acoustic measurements with a phased array are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. First, a set-up with hard wooden side-plates and a cross-shaped array was tested. Calibration measurements with a monopole source placed between the plates showed errors in source strength up to 10 dB, with strong dependence on frequency and source location. A theoretical study identified acoustic interference (standing waves) between the hard plates as the cause of this inaccuracy. Theory predicted much better results when the cross-shaped array was replaced by a sparse array and the hard plates by acoustically lined plates. After application of these modifications in the test set-up, new calibration measurements indeed showed impressive improvement in the ability to determine absolute levels with a phased array. True monopole source levels were recovered within 2 dB for frequencies up to 8 kHz and a tunnel flow speed up to M = 0.22. Moreover, the measured source level was practically independent on the source location.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, electret and MEMS (micro-electrical mechanical systems) microphones have been used as low-cost alternatives to more costly condenser microphones for use in phased arrays. In aeroacoustic testing, phased arrays are ideal for their ability to locate and quantify noise sources. Research into the design, fabrication, and implementation of a low-cost, electronically simple phased array will increase its potential as a common research tool. This paper discusses the design and preliminary testing of a simplified MEMS microphone array for use in aeroacoustic testing. The primary intent of the array design was to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of aeroacoustic sources as opposed to locating them accurately, particularly in a wind tunnel with a square cross section of 152.4 mm x 152.4 mm. Using a number of beamforming algorithms, the design of the phased array was modeled numerically. The phased array was constructed on a single, two-layer PCB (printed circuit board) and composed of 27 MEMS microphones each with built-in amplification and RF protection. The Underbrink equal area aperture array layout was used in the design with 9 spirals each consisting of 3 microphones. Further design and manufacturing details are presented. The array was calibrated and used successfully in preliminary testing using the conventional beamforming technique to locate noise sources within the expected margin of error.},

  Abstract                 = {Many acoustic source mapping methods exist to perform noise source localization and quantification and appear to be powerful tools for acoustic diagnosis in industrial applications. Two classes of methods have known many developments in the last few decades: deconvolution algorithms combined with beamforming (CLEAN, DAMAS, etc) and inverse methods such as the Equivalent Source Method (ESM) and the Generalized Inverse Beamforming (GIB). In this paper, a special attention will be paid to the use of inverse methods in complex acoustic environments. Recently, Suzuki has demonstrated the applicability of the GIB to the study of aerodynamic sound sources [25], highlighting comparable performances to the existing deconvolution techniques. On the other hand, an iterative version of the ESM has been proposed in the context of acoustic imaging in closed spaces, at INSA Lyon [22]. This paper provides a theoretical and experimental comparison between two inverse methods: the iterative ESM and the GIB using various benchmark problems and aeroacoustic experimental data. The experimental set-up consists of a steel rod placed in the potential core of a rectangular jet inside an open-jet anechoic wind tunnel. It will be shown that both methods are based on similar mathematical formulations although they were developed for different application fields. Reconstruction performances of the algorithms in terms of localization and quantification will be discussed as well as their computational efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study aims at assessing the potentiality of the time-reversal (TR) technique to localize sound sources in ﬂows, in the context of wind-tunnel measurements. The proposed method is a two-step procedure : the pressure ﬂuctuations are recorded on a linear array of microphones located outside the ﬂow; then the back-propagation of the acoustic waves is simulated by using the time-reversed Linearized Euler Equations (LEE), with the experimental signals as input data, in order to estimate virtually the position of the sound source from which the waves were radiated. The advantage of the proposed method is that the use of the LEE permits an exact description of the convection and refraction of the radiated waves during their propagation to the array. An experiment in a wind-tunnel has been set up, in which a monopolar sine-wave source is located in the ﬂow. The TR results indicate that the source position can be estimated only if the source-array distance is known. However, further simulations of the experiment show that realistic experimental conﬁgurations are possible, for which the source position can be accurately estimated without this knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {A 70-element microphone phased array was used to identify noise sources in the plume of a solid rocket motor. A weather-resistant case was built and other precautions were taken to protect the sensitive condenser microphones from rain, thunderstorms and other environmental elements during prolonged stay in the outdoor test stand. A camera mounted at the center of the array was used to photograph the plume. In the first phase of the study the array was placed in an anechoic chamber for calibration and validation of the indigenous Matlab® based beamform software. It was found that the “advanced” beamform methods, such as CLEAN-SC were partially successful in indentifying speaker sources placed closer than the Rayleigh criterion. To participate in the field test, all of the equipment was shipped to NASA Marshal Space Flight Center, where the array hardware was rebuilt around the test stand. The sensitive amplifiers and the data acquisition hardware were placed in a safe basement, and 50m long cables were used to connect the microphones, Kulites and the camera. The array case and the microphones were found to withstand the environmental elements as well as the shaking from the rocket plume generated noise. The beamform map was superimposed on a photo of the rocket plume to readily identify the source distribution. It was found that the plume made an exceptionally long, greater than 30 diameter, noise source over a large frequency range. The shock pattern created spatial modulation of the noise source. Interestingly, the concrete pad of the horizontal test stand was found to be a good acoustic reflector: the beamform map showed two distinct source distributions- the plume and its reflection on the pad. The array was found to be most effective in the frequency range of 2 kHz to 10 kHz. As expected, the classical beamform method excessively smeared the noise sources at lower frequencies and produced excessive side-lobes at higher frequencies. The “advanced” beamform routine CLEAN-SC created a series of lumped sources which may be unphysical. We believe that the present effort is the first-ever attempt to directly measure noise source distribution in a rocket plume.},

  Abstract                 = {This study relates to the acoustic imaging of noise sources that are distributed and strongly directional such as in turbulent jets.The goal is to generate high-resolution noise source maps with self-consistency, i.e., their integration over the extent of the noise source region gives the far-field pressure auto-spectrum for a particular emission direction. Self-consistency is possible by including a directivity factor in the formulation of the source cross-spectral density. The resulting source distribution is based on the complex coherence, rather than the cross-spectrum, of the measured acoustic field. For jet noise, whose spectral nature changes with emission angle, it is necessary to conduct the measurements with a narrow-aperture array. Three coherence-based imaging methods were applied to a Mach 0.9 turbulent jet: delay-and-sum beamforming; deconvolution of the beamformer output; and direct spectral estimation that relies on minimizing the difference between the measured and modeled coherences of the acoustic field. The delay-and-sumbeamforming generates noise source maps with strong spatial distortions and sidelobes. Deconvolution leads to a five-fold improvement in spatial resolution and
significantly reduces the intensity of the sidelobes. The direct spectral estimation produces maps very similar to those obtained by deconvolution. The coherence-based noise source maps, obtained by deconvolution or direc tspectral estimation, are similar at small and large observation angles relative to the jet axis.},

  Abstract                 = {An experimental study of simultaneous multipoint measurements in the flowfield and acoustic field of a Mach 1.75 cold-air jet is presented. A series of four optical-deflectometer probes measured turbulent fluctuations in or near the jet flow, and eight microphones recorded the far-field pressure in the direction of peak emission. The correlation methodology involves the coherence between the delay-and-sum beamformer outputs of the optical-deflectometer probes and the microphones. This procedure yields results with greater fidelity and higher coherence levels than obtained with individual optical-deflectometer-to-microphone correlations. With the optical-deflectometer probes in the jet shear layer, there is a significant correlation, on the order of 0.1, between the turbulent fluctuations and farfield noise. As the optical-deflectometer probe moves transversely away from the jet, its correlation with the microphone beamformer first drops and then increases. This trend signifies the transition from hydrodynamic to acoustic pressure fields. In the vicinity of the nozzle exit, the peak coherence between the beamformed optical deflectometer and microphone signals coincides with the physical location of the optical-deflectometer probe. However, as the shear layer thickens downstream, the peak coherence generally lags the probe location, which is a probable result of acoustic refraction by the mean flow.},

  Abstract                 = {The noise source distribution of coaxial jets with a diameter ratio of 1.6 and variable velocity ratio is investigated with a small-aperture microphone phased array. The array design enables differentiation of noise emitted by largescale and fine-scale turbulence structures, which have different directivities. The acoustic data are complemented by pitot surveys of the mean flow, which yield measurements of the primary and secondary cores of the jet. For zero velocity ratio (single-stream jet), the region near the nozzle emits strong high-frequency noise. Increasing the secondary-to-primary velocity ratio suppresses the near-nozzle noise and extends the location of the peak noise downstream, which increases moderately. The axial location of peak noise is approximately situated at the end of the primary core. The suppression of high-frequency noise is explained by the creation and elongation of the secondary core as the velocity ratio increases. The acoustic trends with velocity ratio are similar for small and large array observation angles from which large-scale and fine-scale turbulence noise, respectively, have been shown to radiate. However, the increase in peak noise is more pronounced for the large-scale noise.},

  Abstract                 = {Noise source identification and quantification based on field measurements performed by a microphone array is an usual task in many fields of acoustical engineering. Several approaches have been developed in order to tackle this problem, for example, beamforming, near-field acoustic holography (NAH), inverse methods such as equivalent source method (ESM) and the inverse boundary element method (IBEM), to cite only a few. Depending on the problem configuration (nature of the source field, frequency range of interest and the operational conditions) one method is often preferred over the others. Recently, a Bayesian approach combining physical and probabilistic information was proposed to solve acoustic source reconstruction problems. The deduction of a particular regularization mechanism and a criterion to select the regularization parameter depending on the probabilistic assumptions about the source field is a significant feature of this approach. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical and experimental comparison between Bayesian approach and the ESM to deal with a noise source identification problem},

The method combined a cross-shaped array of 29 microphones developed by ONERA to a D-GPS tracking system operated by Aerospatiale. These tests aimed to validate the method and evaluate its precision and performance. The signal processing used a 32-channel digital tape recorder, where both D-GPS synchronization tops and the acoustic signals were recorded on the ground while D-GPS information was recorded on board. The aircraft performed flyovers above the array at altitudes between 40 and 180 meters and for different flight configurations. An acoustic emitter producing tone noise placed on the aircraft nose has helped for the method calibration. The source is clearly localized with a bias on position that can be lower than 50 cm. The method interest for extended and multiple sources is also confirmed : a few examples of airframe noise source maps are presented for configurations with landing gears and high-lift devices extended.},

Data were acquired with the array at three different locations relative to the engine, two on the side and one in front of the engine. At the two side locations the planar microphone array was parallel to the engine centerline; at the front location the array was perpendicular to the engine centerline. At each of the three locations, data were acquired at eleven different engine operating conditions ranging from engine idle to maximum (take off) speed. Data obtained with the array off to the side of the engine were spatially filtered to separate the inlet and nozzle noise. Tones occurring in the inlet and nozzle spectra were traced to the low and high speed spools within the engine. The phased array data indicate that the Inflow Control Device (ICD) used during this test was not acoustically transparent; instead, some of the noise emanating from the inlet reflected off of the inlet lip of the ICD. This reflection is a source of error for far field noise measurements made during the test. The data also indicate that a total temperature rake in the inlet of the engine is a source of fan noise.},

  Abstract                 = {A measurement technique with microphone array conventional beamforming for indoor linear cascade noise test is developing in NPU (Northwestern Polytechnical University of China) to quantify differences of sound source levels of linear cascade as a result of blade trailing edge modifications. The useful practical experience has been gained during this test. The special indoor microphones placement to avoid introducing ambiguities into sound source localization measurements in the hard-walled room test is firstly described in the paper. The reverberation time of test room is measured and is used to determine the range of direct-field of noise source acoustic radiation. A special microphones indoor placement method is used in the study to reduce the reflection from wall and to increase signal-to-noise ratio of the microphone array. The noise reduction potential of trailing edge serrations in NPU turbine linear cascade with 6 high-loaded LPT turbine blades is investigated experimentally with low cascade outlet Mach number. It is shown that turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise is reduced in the low- to mid- frequency range and the largest noise reduction is about ~2 dB. This magnitude of cascade blade trailing edge noise reduction is obviously smaller than that of the isolated airfoil with using of serrated trailing edge.},

  Abstract                 = {Landing gear is now well known to be a major source of aircraft noise. Several studies have also identified the importance of surface details in the noise generated by landing gears at high frequencies. However, the basic mechanisms of noise generation at lower frequencies are less well understood. In this study, we examine the effect of changes to the overall gear layout on the noise produced. 1/12th scale models containing only the wheels, axles and main struts have been studied using two nested, 48-microphone arrays in the closed-section Markham wind tunnel at Cambridge University. Local fairings have also been added to isolate and identify individual noise sources. Results indicate that shape and placement of the wheels can affect the overall noise level by at least 6dB on simplified four wheel models. Changes in geometry were also found to substantially affect high frequency sources close to the main oleo, suggesting that noise sources from conventional, fully dressed gears might be equally susceptible to small changes in the overall design.},

  Abstract                 = {The Markham aerodynamic wind tunnel at Cambridge University has been modified to include two nested, 48 microphone arrays. The setup has been designed by the Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium in the Netherlands (NLR) and has been used to support the design of landing gear fairings for the Silent Aircraft Initiative. Source power estimates have been computed using a power integration method (POWINT) and verified using the CLEAN source identification method. These are included as part of the NLR beamforming suite. POWINT computes the integrated source power over a specified grid containing the model. The CLEAN algorithm identifies the maximum source on the plot and removes it together with appropriate side lobes. It continues to compute and remove successive maximum sources which can later be added together to give an overall noise measure. In the case where there are background sources or side-lobes visible on source plots, the use of the CLEAN algorithm to estimate source levels allows the user to choose which sources to integrate. The effect of background noise or sources exterior to the model can therefore be rejected. This technique may be of particular interest for array measurements in aerodynamic tunnels which are typically of higher background noise.},

  Abstract                 = {The Markham aerodynamic wind tunnel at Cambridge has been used for a series of aeroacoustic investigations into noise from landing gears and wing slats. This tunnel uses a pair of nested arrays to determine source strength across a range of frequencies. In the course of experiments it has been found that measurements from the smaller, high frequency array can under-estimate source strength at frequencies where the two arrays are expected to overlap. The effect on the spectrum was to mask lower level sources. As a result, the noise reduction available from a particular configuration could appear significantly larger than is actually the case. In this paper we present a discussion of measurements from the tunnel and mechanisms for interference from wind tunnel sources. We confirm the existence of the effect using sources in an anechoic chamber. We also present a method for mitigating interference using the ‘CLEAN-SC’ algorithm with appropriately reshaped scanning grids for beamforming. Results show that more consistent measurements are obtained from the two acoustic arrays, providing some validation of the method. This analysis has the potential to be significant in a variety of closed wind tunnel testing.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the challenges that one faces when developing and designing low noise wind turbines is knowledge of components that radiate the most noise. Typical measurement techniques using a single microphone will result only in the overall sound pressure level radiated by the wind turbines. When it comes to locating sources of noise on a wind turbine, advanced techniques such as the microphone array in conjunction with beamforming algorithms are required. Earlier work has examined wind turbine noise using a microphone array with 148 microphones. These microphones were spread out on the ground over an area of 270 m² near the wind turbine and were not mobile and compact. This paper focuses on using a compact mobile microphone array with advanced beamforming algorithms to measure the noise radiated from wind turbines and identify them with their corresponding sources. Our initial experimental observation on locating the components on a wind turbine radiating noise suggests that it is indeed possible to locate these sources using a compact 24 microphone array with advanced beamforming algorithms such as DAMAS2, CLEAN-SC and TIDY. The qualification experiments performed on the array in laboratory using synthetic noise sources showed the differences between the various advanced beamforming algorithms. In locating the noise sources at desired narrowband frequencies CLEAN-SC was found to perform the best followed by DAMAS2 and conventional frequency domain beamforming. At desired broadband frequencies TIDY performed better in locating the source followed by delay-and-sum. It was also observed that the knowledge of Rayleigh criterion played an important role in locating the sources at the lower frequencies. The experimental results on a full scale wind turbine reveal that most noise radiated were due to aerodynamic noise from the blade tip and mechanical noise from nacelle. Additionally, we were able to measure and locate the noise radiated due to the yaw motors in particular. The initial results presented here offer strong evidence of the potential of compact microphone arrays in measuring and locating the noise sources on wind turbines.},

  Abstract                 = {Wind energy is one of the oldest and cleanest forms of energy and the most developed of the renewable energy sources. Noise made by wind turbines is of key interest for many reasons. The noise made by a machine is a measure of its inefficiency. Wind turbine that are associated with excessive noise and vibrations are wasting energy and are prone to structural damage. In addition, one of the major factors in certification of wind turbines and obtaining a site license is wind turbine noise. It is important to locate the source of wind turbine noise in order to study the noise generation mechanism in wind turbines. One of the emerging methods for acoustic source localization is the acoustic array beamformer. There are various beamforming algorithms that were developed for aeroacoustic measurements. This paper presents a comparison of four such beamforming algorithms namely; Frequency domain beamforming (FDBF), DAMAS2 (DMS2), CLEAN-SC (CLSC) and TIDY. The behavior of these algorithms when exposed to single source, multiple incoherent and coherent sources and an oscillating source are systematically studied to evaluate suitable beamforming algorithms for wind turbine applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The knowledge of noise source locations on a wind turbine is crucial for designing low noise wind turbines. It is also important to monitor the noise from the wind turbine, be it mechanical or aerodynamic noise, to monitor the health of the wind turbine. Currently compliance standards for wind turbine noise are based on single microphone measurements at various designated locations around a wind turbine. This only provides amplitude and frequency data of the overall wind turbine noise. It is however impossible to locate noise sources with a single microphone. A sophisticated method, namely the use of a microphone phased array with advanced beamforming is necessary. Typical microphone arrays that have been used in the past for monitoring aircraft noise and wind turbine noise are very large ranging up to 300 m^2 in area with about 150 microphones. The setup is xed for a particular wind turbine and takes considerable amount of time. Our idea is to use a compact microphone array to locate and separate wind turbine noise sources successfully with the use of advanced beamforming methods such as DAMAS2, CLSC and TIDY. Such a compact tool could be used to measure multiple wind turbines as the apparatus is not xed and will be much faster and easier to make measurements. A GE 1.5 MW full scale production wind turbine was used in our study with an Optinav 24 microphone array (of area 1.5 m^2). A wind screen was used to cover the microphone array to eliminate ambient air interaction with the microphones. On site calibration was performed to account for the loss in amplitude due to the wind screen. The frequency spectrum of the wind turbine was studied to identify the contribution of various noise sources on the wind turbine such as mechanical noise from the nacelle and tower and aerodynamic noise from the blades. The low frequency noise component was found to be due to amplication of noise from the nacelle through the tower of the wind turbine. Mid and high frequency noise components were attributed to trailing edge noise and blade tip vortex noise from the blade. The cooling fan in the nacelle was also observed to radiate high frequency noise. It was also observed that during the yaw motor operation the structural noise was amplied considerably. Detailed discussions and the results of the experiments are presented in this paper},

A backward-facing step is used to create a separated flow, thereby inducing a region of elevated free-stream turbulence downstream of the step. Velocity measurements and a flow visualization technique are used to complement microphone measurements. It is shown that flow separation can be distinguished from flow-edge interaction noise due to their different dependencies on Mach number and observation angle. Flow separation noise is produced several centimeters downstream of the flow-edge interaction noise and is more dominant at high Mach numbers. The performance of the beamforming algorithms TIDY, DAMAS2, and CLEAN-SC are evaluated. It is observed that all the beamforming algorithms provide good separation of free-stream noise and flow-edge interaction noise at the relatively high frequencies considered although CLEAN-SC tends to yield output powers that are typically 3 dB lower.},

  Abstract                 = {A new approach to the deconvolution of acoustic sources has been developed and is presented in this work. The goal of this postprocessing is to simplify the beamforming output by suppressing the side lobes and reducing the sources’ main lobes to single (or a small number of) points that accurately identify the noise sources’ positions and their actual levels. In this work, a new modeling technique for the beamforming output is proposed. The idea is to use an image-processing-like approach to identify the noise sources from the beamforming maps: that is, recognizing lobe patterns in the beamformed output and relating them to the noise sources that would produce that map. For incoherent sources, the beamforming output is modeled as a superposition of point-spread functions and a linear system is posted. For coherent sources, the beamforming output is modeled as a superposition of complex pointspread functions and a nonlinear system of equations in terms of the sources’ amplitudes is posted. As a first approach to solving this difficult problem, the system is solved using a new two-step procedure. In the first step, an approximated linear problem is solved. In the second step, an optimization is performed over the nonzero values obtained in the previous step. The solution to this system of equations renders the sources’ positions and amplitudes. In the case of coherent sources, their relative phase can also be recovered. The technique is referred as noise source localization and optimization of phased-array results. A detailed analytical formulation, numerical simulations, and sample experimental results are shown for the proposed postprocessing.},

The method allows the reduction of the mainlobe width of acoustic point sources in the map and can thus be applied for the improvement of the usually very bad image contrast in the lower frequency range and also for a better separation of closely lying sources which can not be clearly resolved by simple delay-and-sum beamforming. An outstanding property of the proposed algorithm is that it does not rely on the knowledge of the point spread function which is needed in complete deconvolution approaches. The iteration procedure merely utilizes the local curvature information that is already hidden within the acoustic beamforming map to sharpen the individual sources while simultaneously smoothing out disturbing high frequency components that otherwise would lead to numerical instability and unlimited amplification of unwanted small false signal and noise components.},

  Abstract                 = {Phased microphone arrays are used in a variety of applications for the estimation of acoustic source location and spectra. The popular conventional delay-and-sum beamforming methods used with such arrays suffer from inaccurate estimations of absolute source levels and in some cases also from low resolution. Deconvolution approaches such as DAMAS have better performance, but require high computational effort. A fast beamforming method is proposed that can be used in conjunction with a phased microphone array in applications with focus on the correct quantitative estimation of acoustic source spectra. This method bases on an eigenvalue decomposition of the cross spectral matrix of microphone signals and uses the eigenvalues from the signal subspace to estimate absolute source levels. The theoretical basis of the method is discussed together with an assessment of the quality of the estimation. Experimental tests using a loudspeaker setup and an airfoil trailing edge noise setup in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel show that the proposed method is robust and leads to reliable quantitative results.},

  Abstract                 = {The noise generated by the flow around airfoils continues to be one of the important aeroacoustic noise sources. Innovative techniques for airfoil noise reduction are, therefore, of great importance. The present experimental study deals with the use of porous material for the construction of airfoils and the subsequent noise reduction. The use of such material controls the flow around the airfoil and has an influence on the sound generation. The analysis focuses on the characterization of the influence of the porous material parameters, especially the flow resistivity and the porosity, on the noise generation. Results of aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests on several porous and non-porous SD 7003 model scale airfoils are compared. Using microphone array measurements, it was found that not only the overall sound pressure level, but also the spectral characteristics depend on the parameters of the porous material. While the overall sound pressure level decreases in the order of a few decibel, at lower frequencies the reduction is considerable larger and extends 10 dB in some cases. Additionally, the influence of the material parameters on drag and lift is discussed. The aerodynamic performance of the porous airfoils is in general inferior to that of non-porous airfoils. However, there appear to be sets of material parameters that provide a considerable decrease in sound generation and only a minor degradation of aerodynamic effciency.},

The method, which extends beamforming’s algorithm capabilities, consists in reconstructing an equivalent source power distribution using a Green’s function transfer matrix and an adapted inversion procedure. Generally speaking, propagation transfer function inversion is an important point when using inverse methods to identify sound sources. It is, for example, responsible for the efficiency of the method and must be adapted to the measured acoustic field. This paper compares two inversion methods, the first being based on a singular value decomposition operation and the second on an iterative algorithm.},

This article will point out some of the main problems connected to this practically often difficult task and it also develops some proposals for a more systematic evaluation of acoustic array beamforming systems. Some useful quantities and evaluation methods which seem appropriate for a possible classification of beamforming systems will be proposed and discussed in detail.

  Abstract                 = {Conventional Beamforming maps frequently show a low contrast and an unsatisfying spatial resolution especially at lower frequencies. This paper presents a new method for the improvement of phased array results using a Multi-Modal-Beamforming approach. The method allows the reduction of the main lobe width as well as the suppression of the side lobes of acoustic sources in the map and can thus be applied for the improvement of the usually very bad image contrast in the lower frequency range and also for a better separation of closely lying sources which can not be clearly resolved by simple delay-and-sum Beamforming. An outstanding property of the proposed algorithm is that it yields the possibility of synthesizing nearly arbitrary acoustic maps using a low number of phase mode excitations. The presented method is applicable even for the separation of correlated sources, which is impossible using the conventional Beamforming method.},

To realize this, the DB ‘Low Noise Railway’ programme deals simultaneously with the noise treatment of trains and the wheel/rail system as well as other topics. The assessment of a particular sound experience as annoying noise is a very personal judgement and cannot be dealt with by physical quantities alone. To permit a better understanding of this phenomenon and to support the legislative authorities, the assessment of noise quality is being investigated in detail. To reduce railway noise, the exact location and the magnitude of the different sound sources have to be known. This can be analyzed with an array of many microphones which has been developed by DB in the last few years. Most recently, DB has developed the acoustic concept of the ‘Specially Monitored Track (SMT)’ into a practical application and is now starting to upgrade SMT to increased performance and at a lower cost.},

  Abstract                 = {Circular arrays of wall mounted microphones are often used to deduce the circumferential mode content of acoustic fields propagating inside circular or annular ducts. When microphone availability is limited, circular arrays of equally spaced microphones can be rotated to multiple circumferential clocking positions, and the data from multiple clocking positions of the array can be combined together using a reference timing signal to increase the modal analysis resolution when analyzing shaft synchronous signals such as fan tone noise. However, when the data sets from different clocking positions are combined, phase errors are introduced due to the inability to precisely align the time history sequences. These phase errors can result in the generation of spurious modes in the modal decomposition analysis. The mode orders and amplitudes of these modes can be deduced from theoretical considerations. These results can help identify the presence of spurious modes in fan rig modal measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study was to complete an experimental investigation of the noise generated by a dual-slotted Circulation Control (CC) airfoil. It has been well documented that the introduction of fluid at relatively small mass flow rates through a slot at the trailing edge of elliptical airfoils can be advantageous to the lift and drag characteristics of these control surfaces. The noise generation mechanisms associated with such devices, however, are not well understood. The sound generated by a CC model was measured utilizing a microphone array for relatively high Reynolds numbers ( ~ 700,000) and low free stream Mach number ( < 0.1). Sound measurements suggest that the noise generated by the slot-jet flow (with and without external flow) contains distinct spectral features which occur at specific frequencies that do not scale with the slot-jet velocity. When both the external and slot-jet flows were activated a power law velocity scaling of the noise levels was not apparent. The internal cavity resonances associated with the slot-jet plenum were not observed to affect the sound generated by the CC model.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based directional acoustic array is presented to demonstrate key scaling technologies that can reduce cost, improve speed, and increase mobility over conventional array technologies. The system uses 16 hybrid-packaged piezoresistive silicon microphones mounted to a printed-circuit-board and a high-speed signal processing system to generate the array response over 2400 scan location in under 20 sec. Material construction costs for the array were reduced by two orders of magnitude over conventional array systems. The hybrid microphone packages show an average sensitivity of 831 mV/Pa with matched magnitude (±0.6 dB) and phase (± 1 degree) responses between devices. The measured array response matches the theoretical response over the frequency range of 3 kHz to 8 kHz with a localization error of ± 0.3 in. The array has a minimum detectable signal of 43.5 dB SPL for a 1 Hz bin at 6 kHz and a maximum pressure input of at least 160 dB SPL. These results represent a proof-of-concept
demonstration of a high speed, low cost directional acoustic array system.},

  Abstract                 = {Out-of-flow acoustic array measurements in open jet wind tunnels are hampered by the presence of the turbulent shear layer. Signal coherence between pairs of microphones in the array is reduced because sound from a wind tunnel model passes through the shear layer. As a result, the spatial resolution of the beamforming images is significantly lower than without wind, and integrated sound levels are too low. In this paper, a method is discussed to counteract the effects of this shear layer induced coherence loss. This method features the use of one or more miniature loudspeakers, mounted non-intrusively on a wind tunnel model. By instantaneously measuring the unsteady time delay between such a speaker and each of the microphones, corrections can be made to counteract the coherence loss. Such a method for improving phased array results is already applied successfully in the field of radio astronomy, where a well-known bright star is used to define corrections for the turbulence in the atmosphere. This paper presents an implementation of this “Guide Star” method for acoustic arrays. An application to measurements on an A320 model in the open jet of the DNW-LLF is presented. Provided that a number of conditions are fulfilled, the method proves to work well.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the possibility of source location by phased array beamforming on fan and stator of turbofan engines using an intake wall-mounted microphone array. To demonstrate the feasibility, beamforming techniques were applied to existing measured data of a circular microphone array in the intake of a fan rig. This array is normally used for azimuthal mode detection. From the measured data set a test case was selected with low engine speed, and with an intake liner between the fan and the array. Beamforming methods with both stationary and rotating focus are applied, and the contributions of tonal noise and broadband noise were separated. Thus, tonal and broadband noise sources can be identified on both fan and stator. The free-field Green’s function is used for the definition of the steering vectors, thereby ignoring duct wall reflections. By a simulation study it is shown that the presence of an intake liner is a necessary condition for obtaining meaningful beamforming results. Further simulations showed that significantly improved beamforming results can be obtained with an in-duct “cage” array consisting of a number of parallel microphone rings.},

  Abstract                 = {When an aero-acoustic source is close to a reflecting wall, results from conventional phased array beamforming techniques are disturbed by the nearby mirror source, which is coherent with the original source. The recalculated source spectrum tends to deviate from the spectrum of the same source obtained in an anechoic environment. A periodic modulation of the spectrum occurs, which is most prominent at low frequencies. In this paper, a number of non-conventional beamforming techniques to correct for this spectral modulation is investigated. First, a technique is discussed which adds the mirror source to the transmission model. It was found that this technique is not very suitable because of its lack of robustness. Then, a more robust beamforming technique is proposed that minimises the influence of a given mirror source. By this technique, much better results were found. Nevertheless, at low frequencies the method still suffers from lack of robustness. Finally, a modification to this minimisation technique is proposed which preserves the robustness. Using this “controlled minimisation” technique, the best agreement was found between the recalculated spectra of a source close to a wall and the same source in anechoic conditions. The beamforming techniques were applied to array measurements on a calibration source in the DNW Low Speed Wind Tunnel LST.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is described for the location of moving sources by a microphone array. This method can be applied to out-of-flow measurements in an open jet wind tunnel. For that purpose, an expression is derived for the pressure Held of a moving monopole in a uniform flow. It is argued that the open jet shear layer does not form a serious obstacle. A technique is described for reconstruction of power spectra with high signal/noise ratio. The method was implemented for rotating sources, resulting in the computer program ROSI ("Rotating Source Identifier")* Applications of ROSI are given for rotating whistles, blades of a helicopter in hover and wind turbine blades. The test with the rotating whistles demonstrated convincingly the capability to reconstruct the emitted sound. On the helicopter blades, rotating broadband noise sources were made clearly visible. On the wind turbine blades, noise emitted from the leading and trailing edge could be distinguished well.},

  Abstract                 = {For wind tunnel array measurements, the source power integration technique has proved to be a valuable technique to determine absolute source levels. This paper describes the extension of the source power integration technique to moving sources, and the application to fly-over array measurements on landing aircraft at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The technique is applied in combination with a modified version of the Delay-and-Sum beamforming technique, which includes microphone- and frequency-dependent weight factors. These weight factors are used to correct for microphone spatial density and to account for the effects of coherence loss. This beamforming technique works well in combination with the array design, which consists of a number of concentric rings of microphones, with increasing density towards the center. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the extended source power integration technique is able to determine absolute levels from fly-over array measurements, when it is used in combination with the special beamforming technique and the Schiphol array design. Thus, absolute quantification of difference source regions on an aircraft is feasible. Microphone auto-correlations must be included in the beamforming process in order to obtain correct integrated levels, although acoustic images look better when beamforming is done without auto-correlations. The source power integration technique is applied to a Boeing 737-400, and to an Airbus A340.},

The flight trajectory has to be known in order to reconstruct the signal at the source from the Doppler shifted microphone data and map the sound sources by applying time domain beamforming. Different array types can be used depending on the equipment available, other constraints of the experiment, and the desired spatial resolution and dynamic range of the sound source maps. In order to obtain quantitative results, a deconvolution of the maps with the point spread function of the array has to performed. This compensates the imaging properties of the microphone array. From the deconvoluted source maps, the acoustic power can be integrated over different source regions in order to obtain a ranking of the sources.},

  Abstract                 = {The sound radiation from the nozzle, i.e. the core noise, of a BR700 aero-engine is studied with the aid of a phased line array of microphones. The engine was mounted on a noise-test pylon, and the microphone array consisted of 64 microphones laid out on the ground along a line parallel with the jet. The microphone signals and the pressure fluctuations in the combustion chamber of the engine measured with a rumble probe were recorded simultaneously. The sound emitted from the nozzle is studied for emission angles ranging from 60 to 135 degrees relative to the forward direction with a sub-array of 25 microphones. The focused, time shifted signal of the sub-array is used to calculate the coherence with the signal of the rumble probe. The coherence between the microphone signal focused on the nozzle and the rumble probe was found to be surprisingly high for low engine power settings at frequencies below 300Hz. For higher power settings, coherence is considerably reduced. The coherent output power is compared with farfield microphone spectra in order to assess the contribution of the core noise to the total noise emitted by the engine. It may be concluded that at low power settings, where other sound sources are relatively weak, noise originating from the combustion chamber is a major contributor to the noise emitted from the nozzle. The combined array and correlation techniques are shown to be useful tools for core noise investigations.},

In order to assess the impact of the room acoustics on the sound field, reference measurements under free-field conditions were performed on the airfield in Cochstedt. The microphone array data was analysed using classical spectral methods. With the SODIX (Source Directivity in the Cross Spectral Matrix) method, equivalent source distributions for different freqency bands and emission directions were calculated from the Cochstedt and Hamburg data. They show sources at the engine inlet, nozzle and along the jet. The main result of a comparative analysis of the data is that the conditions in the hangar are suitable for jet-noise measurements of an aircraft during ground tests.},

De-dopplerised narrow-band frequency spectra averaged over a large number of microphones were used. Alternatively, the noise emission from the inlet of each engine was evaluated with both engines at take-off power with the aid of a phased microphone array focused on each moving engine inlet. The results show as expected that buzz-saw noise is mainly radiated in the forward arc. The peaks at multiples of the shaft frequency can easily be identified in the de-dopplerised narrow-band spectra. The directivity of a number of frequency components is evaluated. The characteristics of buzz-saw noise are seen to vary between individual engines and even, for the same engine, between different fly-overs. The resulting directivities also indicate that mode scattering has a large influence on the radiated buzz-saw noise field.},

  Abstract                 = {The noise emission of the Boeing MD-11 with CF6-80C2 engines can be reduced substantially during the landing approach. This is the result of a flight-test campaign usinjg a phased microphone array, which was performed by Lufthansa and DLR in 2002. The landing noise is dominated by a strong tonal radiation at the blade-passing frequency. Operating the aircraft with the flaps set to 35 degrees rather than to 50 degrees reduces the tone level substantially. The tone vanishes completely, when the wing mounted engines are operated with a lower speed and the tail mounted engine with a higher speed while keeping the flap setting 35 degrees. Implementation of this differential thrust operation in daily routine would require a modification of the thrust schedule and its certification. A further strong tone is emitted from a position close to the main landing gear of the aircraft. Its precise origin is still unclear, but it is assumed that the tone is generated by a cavity in the landing gear and can be eliminated by small modifications. The broad-band noise at frequencies above 3 kHz in the rear arc is dominated by the noise emission from the primary nozzles of the engines. Installation of a hot-stream liner should yield a considerable noise reduction, which would also reduce the take-off noise. The study demonstrates the value of flyover noise testing with phased arrays of microphones, a method that makes it possible to localize the source positions of the dominating sources.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental noise restrictions play a role in the performance of wind turbines and the dominant source of noise on modern turbines is aeroacoustic noise produced by the blades. A 32 sensor acoustic array has been developed in cooperation between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the University of Colorado to conduct measurements of aeroacoustic noise from a 100 kW wind turbine. The array is capable of broadband measurements from 125 Hz to 8 kHz and can locate noise sources with a spatial resolution of 2 meters. Successful noise measurements have been made on a 36.4 meter hub height wind turbine at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) in Colorado. Currently the array is deployed at the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Bushland, Texas. Sandia National Laboratories is field testing the BSDS blades on a 23 meter hub height turbine and the array is being used to study their noise signature. Trailing edge noise near the blade tip has traditionally been the focus of acoustic array field experiments, but a goal of this test campaign is to observe the inboard sections of the blades as well as the tip region. The many challenges in designing an array for broadband analysis of small wind turbines using a limited number of sensors are presented here along with an overview of the general design process. Initial results from the Bushland, TX field measurements are provided including analysis of low frequency inboard blade noise and higher frequency noise near the blade tip. Noise near the blade tip is strongest on the downward half cycle of rotation as expected, while the inboard noise is present at all rotor azimuth angles.},

Simulated landing, takeoff and approach configurations were evaluated at Mach 0.22 and 0.26. With a phased-microphone array mounted in the ceiling over the inverted model, various noise sources in the high-lift system, landing gear, fins, and other miscellaneous components were located and compared for sound level and frequency at one flyover location. Numerous model modifications and noise-alleviation devices were evaluated. Simultaneous with acoustic measurements, aerodynamic forces were recorded to document aircraft conditions and any performance changes caused by the geometric modifications. Such performance changes
were small and are not reported here. Ten airframe noise sources were identified that might be important to approach and landing noise of the full-scale aircraft The top five noise sources were: a) slat gap, b) main gear, c) flap tips at wing crank, d) flap inboard gap, and e) slat inboard tip. Relative strengths of these sources were documented along with their dependence on aircraft configuration and operating condition. Although the data were scaled to full-scale frequencies, no extrapolation to full-scale flyover was attempted.},

  Abstract                 = {Background noise in wind tunnel environments poses a challenge to acoustic measurements due to possible low or negative Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) present in the testing environment. This paper overviews the application of time domain Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) to microphone array signals with an intended application of background noise reduction in wind tunnels. An experiment was conducted to simulate background noise from a wind tunnel circuit measured by an out-of-flow microphone array in the tunnel test section. A reference microphone was used to acquire a background noise signal which interfered with the desired primary noise source signal at the array. The technique’s efficacy was investigated using frequency spectra from the array microphones, array beamforming of the point source region, and subsequent deconvolution using the Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) algorithm. Comparisons were made with the conventional techniques for improving SNR of spectral and Cross-Spectral Matrix subtraction. The method was seen to recover the primary signal level in SNRs as low as -29 dB and outperform the conventional methods. A second processing approach using the center array microphone as the noise reference was investigated for more general applicability of the ANC technique. It outperformed the conventional methods at the -29 dB SNR but yielded less accurate results when coherence over the array dropped. This approach could possibly improve conventional testing methodology but must be investigated further under more realistic testing conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A significant field of application for microphone arrays is the pass-by measurement of moving objects, mainly trains. In a former article, a special time-domain beamforming algorithm has been introduced which is able to evaluate whole pass-by measurements with respect to computational performance and memory. The evaluation results in a sound pressure level mapping of the train passing. But this mapping only shows the sound sources and their positions represented by coordinate values resulting in interpretation difficulties. A possible solution is the overlay of the sound pressure level mapping with a sketch or a picture of the whole train side view. Since this kind of picture is only available in very few cases or only for single parts of the train, an approach was developed which allows the picture generation of a train side view independently from its composition. In addition to the array measurements, the train’s passing is recorded with a video camera simultaneously. By analyzing the video frames with the SIFT algorithm and combining them based on the gained information, a side view picture of the whole train can be created. The approach presented, including its advantages and requirements, is described in detail. Additionally, further developments are exposed and the capabilities of this approach are demonstrated with an example taken from a variety of measurements completed so far.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2010, a special time-domain beamforming algorithm was presented at the Berlin Beamforming Conference [3]. This algorithm is primarily designed for the sound source localization on moving objects with known velocity (e.g. freight trains). By determining the object trajectory, the acoustic map’s quality can be improved with respect to the Doppler effect. The bottleneck of the algorithm is the time-consuming computational evaluation. Although computational effiency was considered in the algorithm’s first implementation, it can take on hour or more to calculate an acoustic map for a passing train on a regular personal computer. There are several factors which affect the evaluation time, e.g. sampling rate, train speed or the train’s length.
This paper mainly focusses on the computational implementation of the time-domain beamforming algorithm using CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). In general, the implementation on a CPU is rather straight foward if common parallelization libraries are used (e.g. OpenMP), offering only a few variation opportunities. The realizable speed-up is proportional to the number of physical cores in a CPU, and can attain a factor of 8 on recent workstations. Implementing the beamforming algorithm on a GPU with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is more complicated and requires substantial knowledge of the GPU’s processor architecture. Nevertheless, speed-ups of 30 times or even more compensate the high implementation effort. Additionally, a modification of the algorithm according to [3] is presented. Specific calculation coefficients called ”beamfactors” are introduced, which represent the shading factors in time-domain beamforming. Precomputing those factors before beamforming can reduce the evaluation time by a factor of 2, regardless of the computational implementation and the computer system used. Although the beamfactors-algorithm offers a sufficient reduction of computational costs, it has been parallelized on CPU and GPU as well.},

  Abstract                 = {In September 2001, Boeing performed a Noise Technology Flight Test in Glasgow, Montana. During this flight test, Boeing acquired data for several flights with the flaps deployed and the engines at idle to measure airframe noise. Data were acquired with both free-field microphones and with a microphone phased array. The flight test microphone phased array data have been compared with data from two past model-scale tests. One test, using a 6.3%-scale model, was performed in Boeing’s Low Speed Aeroacoustic Facility. The other test, using a 26%-scale model, was performed in NASA Ames’ 40ftx80ft wind tunnel. Results from the tests show many similarities, but at least one major discrepancy. Both model-scale tests show significant amounts of noise being generated from the leading edge slat. The full-scale flight test results show almost no noise being generated from the leading edge. The exact cause of this discrepancy is unknown, but could be caused by Reynolds number effects, detail modeling issues, or beamforming analysis issues.},

Results are presented from airframe noise investigations done in three different pressurized wind tunnels: a DC-10 configuration examined in NASA Ames' 12-ft wind tunnel; a simple landing gear model examined in the NASA Langley's Low Turbulence Pressure Tunnel; a 747-400 examined in DeRA's 5m pressure tunnel.

  Abstract                 = {Experimental and computational results are presented for the aerodynamics and acoustics of an upswept wing with a half-span flap and both a full- and three-quarter span slat. The wing spanned the wind tunnel test section with no exposed wing tip. Concurrent aerodynamic and acoustic measurements were obtained for high-lift riggings representative of landing-approach configurations. Phased microphone array measurements identified two noise sources at the mid-span flap tip that were approximately equal in intensity at 7 kHz. The noise source at the flap forward side edge is dominant at higher frequencies, while the source from the flap aft upper surface is dominant at lower frequencies. The resulting overall spectra generaily decay monotonically with a peak frequency less than 2 kHz, since no peak was evident in the measurement range from 2-38 kHz. Both flap lift and flap-tip noise increase with increasing flap deflection. Raking the flap tip relative to the freestream flow yielded significant changes in the flap-tip vortex formation and resulting noise level. A flap-tip noise model based on flap-tip velocities and flow angles accurately predicted the change in noise with flap deflection and rake-angle variation. A flap-tip fence and porous flap tip both yielded significant overall noise reduction of 3 dB and 4-8 dB, respectively. Two noise sources were identified for the slat. Slat-gap noise was dominant for a low slat loading while slat-tip noise was significant at a high slat loading. The slat-tip flow field is similar to that of the flap tip, and a slat-tip fence resulted in significant noise reduction of 3-6 dB. Slat-gap noise is apparently associated with a feedback mechanism between the recirculating flow in the slat cove and the high-velocity flow through the slat gap. Serration of the slat trailing edge yielded a peak noise reduction of 18 dB while serration of the slat cusp was significantly less effective. Unsteady-pressure and hot-wire measurements revealed important details of both the flap and slat flow structures. Component interactions were found to be small (less than 2 dB) between the flap and slat noise sources.}

To overcome this hurdle, recent acoustic- and flow-diagnostic techniques have been applied to near- and far-field measurements, and the relation between large-scale flow structures and far-field sound as well as properties of jet-noise sources have been investigated in many studies. In this paper, these diagnostic studies are reviewed, particularly focusing on the multi-point measurements including phased-array techniques, and the studies on subsonically convecting round jets, i.e. jets whose phase velocity is less than the speed of sound, are summarized.},

The acoustic data are processed with a generalized-inverse beam-forming algorithm, capable of resolving multipole distributed sources with high resolution regardless of the coherency. The hydrodynamic data are used to construct disturbances associated with instability waves, and acoustic ﬁelds are calculated by imposing these disturbances as near-ﬁeld boundary values. Source maps produced by L3/2 generalized-inverse beam-forming indicate that acoustic ﬁelds upstream of the peak angle are recoverable from detected source distributions, while downstream sound is not representable with superposition up to octupoles even if taking refraction into account. The boundary-value problem demonstrates that the jet-spreading eﬀect, which is included via streamwise growth and decay of the eigenfunctions from linear stability analysis, is too weak to explain the downstream-sound generation. Direct projection from the hydrodynamic data indicates that the downstream sound is governed by disturbances beyond the potential-core end, whose decay rate is gentler and phase velocity is faster than the predictions based on linear stability analysis using PIV mean-ﬂow data.},

The coherent sound signals are then decomposed into multipoles in spherical coordinates, and the primary mode and its axial position are identified for the axisymmetric and first two azimuthal modes. The proposed beam-forming algorithm is applied to an unheated round jet over a range of Mach numbers and frequencies. The result indicates that at low Mach numbers, the second zenithal mode (i.e., quadrupole) appears to be dominant for each azimuthal mode, and the source position slightly shifts downstream with increasing azimuthal mode number.}

A tone signal of a prescribed mode or broadband signal is generated upstream of a curved rectangular duct, and acoustic fields formed in both upstream and downstream stations of the test section are measured with identical wall-mounted microphone arrays. Sound-power distributions of several horizontal and vertical modes including upstream- and downstream-propagating waves can be identified with phased-array techniques, and the results are compared among the four approaches. The comparisons using synthetic data demonstrate that the L2 generalized-inverse algorithm can sufficiently suppress undesirable noise levels and detect amplitude distributions accurately in over-determined cases (i.e. the number of microphones is more than the number of cut-on modes) with minimum computational cost. As the number of cut-on modes exceeds the number of microphones (i.e. under-determined problems), the L1 algorithm is necessary to retain better accuracy. The comparison using test data acquired in the curved duct test rig (CDTR) at NASA Langley Research Center suggests that the L1 / L2 generalized-inverse approach as well as CLEAN can improve the dynamic range of the detected mode by as much as 10 dB relative to conventional beam-forming even with mean flow of M=0.5.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the basis of the beam former (BF) and polar correlation (PC) phased array methods and shows that these provide different information about axially distributed noise sources. In principle, the BF method provides an image of the source CSD, whereas the PC method yields a ‘source strength’ which is an image of a more complex quantity namely the axial wavenumber transform of the source CSD. At first sight the BF method is therefore more useful for diagnostic purposes but the results presented here suggest that the combined effects of resolution and source convection place serious limitations on the source CSD image information and only the source PSD axial shape can be obtained with the BF method, not its absolute level. The PC method provides more limited diagnostic information but yields a source strength at each reference microphone which when integrated over the source length, yields the far-field PSD at that reference microphone. Therefore the PC source strength is arguably the more relevant quantity to measure when determining what proportion of the sound at a particular microphone position comes from each region of the jet axis.},

The pressure captured by a rigid spherical array under free-field conditions is used to compute the expected pressure on a virtual and larger sphere by means of acoustic holography. Beamforming is then applied with the pressure predicted at the virtual array. Since the virtual array has a larger radius compared to the one of the physical array, the low frequencies (the ones with larger wavelength) are better captured by the virtual array, and therefore, the performance of the resulting beamforming system is expected to improve at these frequencies.

One critical application is the localization of noise pollution sources in urban environments, due to an increasing body of evidence linking noise pollution to adverse effects on human health. Current noise mapping techniques often fail to accurately identify noise pollution sources, because they rely on the interpolation of a limited number of scattered sound sensors. Aiming to produce accurate noise pollution maps, we developed the SoundCompass, a low-cost sound sensor capable of measuring local noise levels and sound field directionality. Our first prototype is composed of a sensor array of 52 Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones, an inertial measuring unit and a low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This article presents the SoundCompass’s hardware and firmware design together with a data fusion technique that exploits the sensing capabilities of the SoundCompass in a wireless sensor network to localize noise pollution sources. Live tests produced a sound source localization accuracy of a few centimeters in a 25-m2 anechoic chamber, while simulation results accurately located up to five broadband sound sources in a 10,000-m2 open field.},

  Abstract                 = {A new algorithm for estimating noncompact, distributed sources by means of phased array microphone measurements is presented and experimentally implemented to determine the noise source distribution in a subscale jet flow. Conventional beamforming techniques, developed for spatially well-separated point sources, can lead to significant errors when applied to reconstruct continuous source distributions such as jet noise. A new beamforming approach is developed for estimating such continuous source distributions. The objective is to recover the average source strength over a small region around each focus position as opposed to seeking the exact source strength at each spatial location as in conventional approaches. This strategy overcomes the drawbacks of conventional methods and yields a beamformer with uniform spatial resolution and accuracy over a large frequency range. The measurement technique is applied to the localization of broadband noise sources in a high-subsonic, heated, turbulent jet flow and shows good comparisons with prior measurements using other techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {The standard Capon beamformer (SCB) is sensitive to the mismatch between the assumed and actual array steering vector, which occurs often in practice. Recently a robust Capon beamformer (RCB) was proposed by extending the SCB to the case of uncertain array steering vectors. In certain applications such as acoustic imaging, it is desirable that the beamwidth is constant across the frequency bins. This prevents future corrections for different frequencies and contributes to consistent sound pressure level ~SPL! estimation, which means that for an acoustic wideband monopole source with a flat spectrum the acoustic image for each frequency bin stays the same. However, the beamwidth of RCB decreases with frequency, which can lead to inconsistent imaging results across the frequencies. In this paper two beamformers are proposed, namely a constant-beamwidth robust Capon beamformer ~CBRCB! and a constant-powerwidth robust Capon beamformer (CPRCB), as extensions of RCB for consistent wideband acoustic imaging. Both CBRCB and CPRCB are more robust against array steering vector errors and finite sample size problems than SCB and have better resolution and interference suppression capability than data-independent beamformers. Moreover, they both can be efficiently implemented. The effectiveness of CBRCB and CPRCB is demonstrated via a number of simulated and experimental examples.},

In this work, CS is extended to array beamforming applications and two algorithms (CSB-I and CSB-II) are presented with the assumption of spatially sparse and incoherent sound sources. The two algorithms are examined using both simulation and aeroacoustic experiments. The simulation case clearly shows that the CSB-I algorithm is quite sensitive to the sensing noise. The CSB-II algorithm, on the other hand, is more robust to noisy measurements. In addition, aeroacoustic tests of an airplane model demonstrate the good performance in terms of resolution and sidelobe rejection of CSB-II algorithm.},

A 63 channel planar microphone array parallel to the plane of pigeon wings was used to measure the sound pressure. Then, conventional beamforming method and CLEAN-SC method were adopted to yield the corresponding narrowband acoustic images and broadband sound pressure spectral results. The acoustic images show that the flight noise of the pigeon is mostly from the wing tips. In addition, the spectral waveform of the pigeon flight shows a slope of -20 dB/dec between 500 Hz and 5 kHz.},

In order to obtain the accurate noise source distributions, the microphone array is installed near the train model. The influence of the shear layer around the main flow on the directivity of the microphone array is clarified so that the microphone array should be set in the shear layer rather than the outside of the flow. Analysis of the noise source localization reveals the principal noise sources around the gap, which suggests efficient approaches to the noise reduction. Firstly, we found that the noise level of the gap section with rounded edge can be effectively reduced by approximately 7 dB compared with that of the case with current condition. We also confirmed qualitatively the effect of noise reduction techniques for the gap section by the field test.},

  Abstract                 = {Using microphone arrays for estimating source locations and strengths has become common practice in aeroacoustic applications. The classical delay-and-sum approach suffers from low resolution and high sidelobes and the resulting beamforming maps are difficult to interpret. The deconvolution approach for the mapping of acoustic sources (DAMAS) deconvolution algorithm recovers the actual source levels from the contaminated delay-and-sum results by defining an inverse problem that can be represented as a linear system of equations. In this paper, the deconvolution problem is carried onto the sparse signal representation area and a sparsity constrained deconvolution approach (SC-DAMAS) is presented for solving the DAMAS inverse problem. A sparsity preserving covariance matrix fitting approach (CMF) is also presented to overcome the drawbacks of the DAMAS inverse problem. The proposed algorithms are convex optimization problems. Our simulations show that CMF and SC-DAMAS outperform DAMAS and as the noise in the measurements increases, CMF works better than both DAMAS and SC-DAMAS. It is observed that the proposed algorithms converge faster than DAMAS. A modification to SC-DAMAS is also provided which makes it significantly faster than DAMAS and CMF. For the correlated source case, the CMF-C algorithm is proposed and compared with DAMAS-C. Improvements in performance are obtained similar to the uncorrelated case.},

  Abstract                 = {Aeroacoustic problems pose some challenges to the conventional techniques normally used to source localization and identification. The main difficulties are that sources are normally distributed, with coherent and incoherent regions, and with simultaneous mono and multipole radiation patterns. Among the most recent ones, the Generalized Inverse Beamforming method has the promise to meet these challenges. In this paper, the potential for identification of compact sources in close vicinity, similar to a distributed source, and the potential to identify a dipole center and orientation, induced by two compact sources, are illustrated in two no-flow tests. Results obtained in semi-anechoic room are compared to numerical prediction, and the generalized inverse beamforming performance compared to the conventional beamforming results. This validation is a preparation for the application of the method to aeroacoustic problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional beamforming, among the several techniques that can be used for noise source localization, has been widely used in complex problems, including aeroacoustics applications. The sound generated by ﬂow turbulence can present a distributed coherent source region, which presents some challenges to the conventional beamforming localization accuracy. The Generalized Inverse Beamforming (GIB) is a recent method aiming at the identiﬁcation of coherent or incoherent, distributed or compact, monopole or multipole sources. This method is based on the microphone array cross-spectral eigenstructure, resulting in a robust localization technique. In this work, the performance of the GIB method is investigated for two simple cases in comparison to conventional beamforming. The ﬁrst test case, a simple monopole, illustrates the frequency range accuracy, and the second test case, two monopoles in coherent radiation, illustrates the different performance in coherent scenarios. Numerical investigation is used to deﬁne the test array aperture and distance to the target region. In order to improve the generalized inverse estimation on the coherent case, a new hybrid estimation is proposed. This consists in creating a source mapping that is comparable to the conventional mapping based on the generalized inverse mapping and the array Point Spread Function. The offsetting between the hybrid mapping and the conventional mapping indicates the quality of the generalized inverse estimation and the hybrid estimation points to the actual sources overall strength.},

  Abstract                 = {The application of beamforming algorithms to locate sound sources on fast-moving objects like trains or cars can be troublesome. Typically, very short signal frames have to be used to achieve an “acoustic still image” for the pinpointing of sound sources on the observed moving object. On the other hand, if the trajectory of the object is given or can be gathered by additional measurements, it can be used to computationally eliminate the object movement allowing large signal frames, to correct sound pressure levels assuming spherical wave propagation, and to remove frequency shifts caused by the Doppler effect. To achieve this, a simple time-domain beamforming algorithm has been developed that basically reconstructs and evaluates the source signals of hypothetical point monopoles on the objects surface. The algorithm itself and ways to optimize it to reduce memory usage and CPU time when processing measurements of very large objects are shown in detail. Results of measurements on trains that underline its capabilities are demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {The flow around obstacles is often very complex, leading to distributed aeroacoustic sources. In experimental investigations, microphone arrays can help to separate, analyze and quantify these partial sources. In order to do so, a microphone array with a high spatial resolution and a high dynamic range is essential. In this publication, the setup and application of a microphone array for aeroacoustic measurements in a model scale wind tunnel will be discussed. Initially, the development and optimization of the microphone array will be described. Preliminary considerations and the derivation of major quality criteria will be explained. Methods for the enhancement of the measurement results as well as for the source characterization will be presented. These methods include the variation of the measurement conditions as well as advanced signal processing. Results of measurements on various test structures will be presented. These structures do all possess aeroacoustic sources with dipole sound radiation but do also exhibit different frequency behaviour of narrowband (cylinder) and broadband (generic wing profile) radiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Microphone Arrays installed on the ground are used to identify and to quantify noise sources at aircrafts. This is an important tool to assess novel treatments, to establish an empirical noise data base for noise prediction tools and to validate acoustic source models used by computational aero acoustics. An array can comprise several hundred microphones and is widely used for stationary applications in the automotive industry and in wind tunnel facilities. The focus of this presentation is on a specialised array methodology for moving objects, which are far away from the array, e.g. the altitude of an aircraft is about 200 meters for those measurements. The beam-forming map exhibits side lobes, which make the localisation and quantification of sources rather difficult. Therefore an Inverse Source Density Modelling is introduced to remove the side lobes. Care has to be taken to mitigate the frequency shift due to the Doppler effect and to be capable of processing badly conditioned matrices. The success of this approach is discussed based on measurement data.},
