  abstract  = {Abstract This paper answers the challenge as how to automatically
	select a good regularization parameter when solving inverse problems
	in acoustics. A Bayesian solution is proposed that consists either
	in directly finding the most probable value of the regularization
	parameter or, indirectly, in estimating it as the ratio of the most
	probable values of the noise and source expected energies. It enjoys
	several nice properties such as ease of implementation and low computational
	complexity (the proposed algorithm boils down to searching for the
	global minimum of a 1D cost function). Among other advantages of
	the Bayesian approach, it makes possible to appraise the sensitivity
	of the reconstructed acoustical quantities of interest with respect
	to regularization, a performance that would be otherwise arduous
	to achieve. },

  abstract     = {The development of array processing methods to extract the useful characteristics of acoustic sources such as their locations and absolute levels, starting from the measured sound field is one of the main issues in aero-acoustics. Generally, the methods are based on a deconvolution operation to remove the undesirable effects of smearing produced by array response. This process should be carried out after the additive noise has been suitably attenuated and, ideally, the deconvolution operator should amplify the noise as little as possible. We show that when a reference of noise is known beforehand, and under certain assumptions, that it is possible both to remove the smearing effect produced by array response and to reduce the noise contamination of the results using a method called Spectral Estimation Method With Additive Noise. This method has been applied to computer and experimental simulations involving acoustic sources radiating in a noisy environment. The levels of the sources were found with a good accuracy and the background noise highly reduced, confirming the validity of the approach and the good performance of the proposed method.},
